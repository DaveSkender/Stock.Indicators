> Please only suggest new indicators from reputable published industry experts or if they are widely accepted time-tested standards.  We do not implement community contributed indicators from third-party charting platforms; however, we do support your ability to extend the library with [custom indicators](https://dotnet.stockindicators.dev/custom-indicators/).
