WHEN REQUESTING NEW INDICATORS:

If requesting a new indicator, please provide references to
the original author's publication of the indicator recipe.
Avoid sending potentially deviant third-party reproductions
or software code, if possible.

Please only suggest new indicators from reputable published
industry experts or if they are widely accepted time-tested
standards.

We do not implement community contributed indicators from
third-party charting platforms.  If you need custom indicators,
we provided features to help you extend the library.
See https://dotnet.stockindicators.dev/custom-indicators.

If you require contract custom development, please contact
our parent organization at https://skenderco.com
