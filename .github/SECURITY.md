# Security policy

All of our public non-archived repositories are supported with security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send it to [support@facioquo.com](mailto:support@facioquo.com).  If a patch is not available, we may share that vulnerability through GitHub's reporting features; otherwise, we will communicate fixes in our release notes after they're remediated.
