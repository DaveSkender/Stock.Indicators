# Feature Specification: v3.0 Streaming Indicators Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `feature/v3-streaming-indicators`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: In Progress *(Updated 2025-09-28)*  
**Input**: User description: "v3 streaming indicators implementation with buffer style incrementors and enhanced performance for real-time data processing"

## Overview

Implement streaming indicators for Stock Indicators v3.0 to support real-time data processing from WebSockets and other active quote sources. This includes buffer-style incrementors, enhanced performance optimization, and backward-compatible API design.

## Background

Based on PR #1014, v3.0 focuses on streaming capabilities that allow indicators to process incremental quote updates efficiently without full recalculation. The current implementation has prototypes for EMA and SMA indicators.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Real-time Trading Platforms**: Traders need indicators that update instantly as new price data arrives from WebSocket feeds
2. **Algorithmic Trading Systems**: High-frequency trading systems require sub-millisecond indicator updates
3. **Live Charting Applications**: Chart applications need smooth indicator updates without UI freezing
4. **Backtesting with Streaming**: Simulate real-time conditions during historical backtesting

### Success Scenarios

- User connects to live price feed → indicators update incrementally with each new quote
- User chains multiple streaming indicators → chained operations maintain real-time performance
- User switches between streaming and batch modes → seamless API compatibility
- User processes high-volume data → memory usage remains stable over time

## Functional Requirements

### Core Streaming Features

- **FR1**: Indicators MUST support incremental updates with new quotes without full recalculation
- **FR2**: Streaming mode MUST maintain mathematical accuracy equivalent to batch processing
- **FR3**: Buffer management MUST efficiently handle historical data windows for indicator calculations
- **FR4**: API MUST remain backward compatible with existing v2.x implementations

### Performance Requirements

- **FR5**: Single quote processing MUST complete within 1 millisecond for common indicators
- **FR6**: Memory usage MUST remain stable during extended streaming operations
- **FR7**: Chained streaming operations MUST maintain performance characteristics
- **FR8**: Buffer size MUST be optimized for typical indicator lookback periods

### Integration Requirements

- **FR9**: Streaming indicators MUST integrate with catalog automation system
- **FR10**: WebSocket integration examples MUST be provided
- **FR11**: Migration path from v2.x MUST be documented
- **FR12**: Performance benchmarking suite MUST validate streaming vs batch performance

## Key Entities

- **StreamingIndicator**: Base interface for indicators supporting incremental updates
- **BufferManager**: Manages circular buffers for historical quote data
- **StreamHub**: Coordinates multiple streaming indicators and data distribution
- **Quote**: Individual price/volume data point for processing
- **IndicatorChain**: Sequence of connected streaming indicators

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Immediate Priority)

- Streaming base classes and interfaces
- Buffer management system  
- Hub coordination patterns
- Enhanced EMA/SMA streaming implementations

### Phase 2: Moving Average Expansion

- Extend streaming to all moving average indicators
- Performance tuning and validation
- Integration testing with real data sources

### Phase 3: Broader Indicator Coverage

- Implement streaming for common oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic)
- Volume-based indicator streaming
- Complex multi-timeframe indicators

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish

- Catalog system integration
- Documentation and migration guides
- Community feedback incorporation
- Performance optimization

## Progress Updates

- **2025-09-28** — Task T2.1 (*HMA Streaming Implementation*) is complete via PR [#1397](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/pull/1397): adds `HmaHub`, `HmaList`, catalog wiring, and parity tests that keep streaming aligned with batch accuracy. Next focus stays on T2.2 (*WMA Streaming Implementation*).

## Success Criteria

- All moving average indicators support streaming mode
- Performance benchmarks show >90% reduction in processing time for incremental updates
- Zero breaking changes to existing v2.x APIs
- Complete documentation with WebSocket integration examples
- Comprehensive test coverage for streaming vs batch accuracy

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Must maintain existing double precision approach for performance
- Buffer sizes limited by memory constraints for long-running applications  
- WebSocket integration examples only, not full WebSocket library
- Focus on most commonly used indicators first

## Dependencies

- Completion of catalog utility baseline (#1318)
- Performance testing framework
- Buffer management infrastructure
- Community feedback from preview releases

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Performance degradation**: Comprehensive benchmarking throughout development
- **Memory leaks in buffers**: Automated testing for long-running scenarios  
- **API complexity**: Clear separation between streaming and batch interfaces
- **Mathematical accuracy**: Extensive validation against reference implementations
