```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<MamaResult> results =
  quotes.GetMama(fastLimit, slowLimit);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `fastLimit` | decimal | Fast limit threshold.  Must be greater than `slowLimit` and less than 1.  Default is 0.5.
| `slowLimit` | decimal | Slow limit threshold.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 0.05.

### Historical quotes requirements

Since this indicator has a warmup period, you must have at least `50` periods of `quotes`.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](../../docs/GUIDE.md#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<MamaResult>
```

The first `5` periods will have `null` values for MAMA since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

:warning: **Warning**: The first `50` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### MamaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Mama` | decimal | MESA adaptive moving average (MAMA)
| `Fama` | decimal | Following adaptive moving average (FAMA)

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#content) for more information.

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("MSFT");

// calculate Mama(0.5,0.05)
IEnumerable<MamaResult> results = quotes.GetMama(0.5,0.05);

// use results as needed
MamaResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("MAMA on {0} was ${1}", result.Date, result.Mama);
```

```bash
MAMA on 12/31/2018 was $251.86
```
