# Vortex Indicator (VI)

Created by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman, the [Vortex Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_indicator) is a measure of price directional movement.  It includes positive and negative indicators, and is often used to identify trends and reversals.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<VortexResult> results =
  quotes.GetVortex(lookbackPeriods);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) to consider.  Must be greater than 1 and is usually between 14 and 30.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+1` periods of `quotes`.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](../../docs/GUIDE.md#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<VortexResult>
```

The first `N` periods will have `null` values for VI since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### VortexResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Pvi` | decimal | Positive Vortex Indicator (VI+)
| `Nvi` | decimal | Negative Vortex Indicator (VI-)

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#content) for more information.

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate 14-period VI
IEnumerable<VortexResult> results = quotes.GetVortex(14);

// use results as needed
VortexResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("VI+ on {0} was {1}", result.Date, result.Pvi);
```

```bash
VI+ on 12/31/2018 was 0.871
```
