```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<UlcerIndexResult> results =
  quotes.GetUlcerIndex(lookbackPeriods);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) for review.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 14.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes`.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](../../docs/GUIDE.md#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<UlcerIndexResult>
```

The first `N-1` slow periods + signal period will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### UlcerIndexResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `UI` | decimal | Ulcer Index

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#content) for more information.

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate UI(14)
IEnumerable<UlcerIndexResult> results = quotes.GetUlcerIndex(14);

// use results as needed
UlcerIndexResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("Ulcer Index on {0} was {1}", result.Date, result.UI);
```

```bash
Ulcer Index on 12/31/2018 was 5.73
```
