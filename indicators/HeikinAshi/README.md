```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<HeikinAshiResult> results =
  quotes.GetHeikinAshi();  
```

## Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least two periods of `quotes`; however, more is typically provided since this is a chartable candlestick pattern.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](../../docs/GUIDE.md#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<HeikinAshiResult>
```

The first period will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### HeikinAshiResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Open` | decimal | Modified open price
| `High` | decimal | Modified high price
| `Low` | decimal | Modified low price
| `Close` | decimal | Modified close price

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers](../../docs/UTILITIES.md#content) for more information.

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("MSFT");

// calculate
IEnumerable<HeikinAshiResult> results = quotes.GetHeikinAshi();

// use results as needed
HeikinAshiResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("Heikin-Ashi open price on {0} was ${1}", result.Date, result.Open);
```

```bash
Heikin-Ashi open price on 12/31/2018 was $241.3
```
