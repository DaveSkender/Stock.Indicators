```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<KamaResult> results = Indicator.GetKama(history, erPeriod, fastPeriod, slowPeriod);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `history` | IEnumerable\<[TQuote](../../docs/GUIDE.md#quote)\> | Historical price quotes should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).
| `erPeriod` | int | Number of Efficiency Ratio (volatility) periods (`E`).  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 10.
| `fastPeriod` | int | Number of Fast EMA periods.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 2.
| `slowPeriod` | int | Number of Slow EMA periods.  Must be greater than `fastPeriod`.  Default is 30.

### Minimum history requirements

You must supply at least `2×E` or `E+50` periods of `history`, whichever is more.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `E+100` data points prior to the intended usage date for greater precision.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<KamaResult>
```

The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### KamaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Kama` | decimal | Kaufman's adaptive moving average

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your favorite feed, in Quote format
IEnumerable<Quote> history = GetHistoryFromFeed("MSFT");

// calculate KAMA(10,2,30)
IEnumerable<KamaResult> results = Indicator.GetKama(history,10,2,30);

// use results as needed
KamaResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("KAMA on {0} was ${1}", result.Date, result.Kama);
```

```bash
KAMA on 12/31/2018 was $251.86
```
