# Rate of Change (ROC) and Momentum Oscillator

[Rate of Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_(technical_analysis)), also known as Momentum Oscillator, is the percent change of Close price over `N` lookback periods.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<RocResult> results = Indicator.GetRoc(history, lookbackPeriod);

// usage with optional SMA of ROC (shown above)
IEnumerable<RocResult> results = Indicator.GetRoc(history, lookbackPeriod, smaPeriod);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `history` | IEnumerable\<[TQuote](../../docs/GUIDE.md#historical-quotes)\> | Historical price quotes should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).
| `lookbackPeriod` | int | Number of periods (`N`) to go back.  Must be greater than 0.
| `smaPeriod` | int | Optional.  Number of periods in the moving average of ROC.  Must be greater than 0, if specified.

### Minimum history requirements

You must supply at least `N+1` periods of `history`.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<RocResult>
```

The first `N` periods will have `null` values for ROC since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### RocResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Roc` | decimal | Rate of Change over `N` lookback periods (%, not decimal)
| `RocSma` | decimal | Moving average (SMA) of ROC based on `smaPeriod` periods, if specified

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your favorite feed, in Quote format
IEnumerable<Quote> history = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate 20-period ROC
IEnumerable<RocResult> results = Indicator.GetRoc(history,20);

// use results as needed
RocResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("ROC on {0} was {1}%", result.Date, result.Roc);
```

```bash
ROC on 12/31/2018 was -8.25%
```
