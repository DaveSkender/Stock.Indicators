# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Created by J. Welles Wilder, the [Relative Strength Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index) measures strength of the winning/losing streak over `N` lookback periods on a scale of 0 to 100, to depict overbought and oversold conditions.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<RsiResult> results = Indicator.GetRsi(history, lookbackPeriod);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `history` | IEnumerable\<[TQuote](../../docs/GUIDE.md#quote)\> | Historical price quotes should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).
| `lookbackPeriod` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the lookback period.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 14.

### Minimum history requirements

You must supply at least `N+50` periods of `history`.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `10×N` data points prior to the intended usage date for optimal precision.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<RsiResult>
```

The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

:warning: **Warning**: The first `10×N` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in RSI values for earlier periods.

### RsiResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Rsi` | decimal | RSI over prior `N` lookback periods

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your favorite feed, in Quote format
IEnumerable<Quote> history = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate RSI(14)
IEnumerable<RsiResult> results = Indicator.GetRsi(history,14);

// use results as needed
RsiResult result = results.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("RSI on {0} was {1}", result.Date, result.Rsi);
```

```bash
RSI on 12/31/2018 was 42.08
```
