# Indicators and overlays

The Stock Indicators for .NET library contains financial market technical analysis methods to view price patterns or to develop your own trading strategies in Microsoft .NET programming languages and developer platforms.

Categories include price trends, price channels, oscillators, stop and reverse, candlestick patterns, volume and momentum, moving averages, price transforms, price characteristics, and many classic numerical methods.

## Available Indicators

The following technical indicators are available in the library, organized by category:

### Price Trends

Technical indicators that identify the direction and strength of price movements.

### Price Channels  

Indicators that create channels or bands around price movements to identify support and resistance levels.

### Oscillators

Momentum-based indicators that oscillate between fixed upper and lower bounds to identify overbought/oversold conditions.

### Stop and Reverse

Indicators designed to provide entry and exit signals for trading strategies.

### Candlestick Patterns

Recognition algorithms for traditional Japanese candlestick patterns and other price patterns.

### Volume-based

Indicators that incorporate trading volume to analyze price movements and confirm trends.

### Moving Averages

Various smoothing algorithms that reduce price noise and highlight trends.

### Price Transforms

Utilities for transforming and normalizing price data (OHLC, HLC3, etc.).

### Price Characteristics

Indicators that measure specific characteristics of price movements like volatility, momentum, and statistical properties.

### Numerical Analysis

Classic statistical and mathematical analysis functions for financial time series data.
