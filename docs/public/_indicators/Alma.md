```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<AlmaResult> results =
  quotes.GetAlma(lookbackPeriods, offset, sigma);
```

## Parameters

**`lookbackPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 1, but is typically in the 5-20 range.  Default is 9.

**`offset`** _`double`_ - Adjusts smoothness versus responsiveness on a scale from 0 to 1; where 1 is max responsiveness.  Default is 0.85.

**`sigma`** _`double`_ - Defines the width of the Gaussian [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 6.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<AlmaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### AlmaResult

**`Timestamp`** _`DateTime`_ - date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`Alma`** _`double`_ - Arnaud Legoux Moving Average

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetAlma(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Alma` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetAlma(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
