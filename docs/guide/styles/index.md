## Feature comparison

The library provides three distinct indicator styles to support different use cases.

| Feature | [Batch (Series)](/guide/styles/batch) | [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) | [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| Incrementing | no | yes | yes |
| Batch speed | fastest | faster | fast |
| Scaling | low | moderate | high |
| Class type | static | instance | instance |
| Base interface | `IReadOnlyList` | `IReadOnlyList` (+ `Add`) | `IStreamHub` |
| Complexity | lowest | moderate | highest |
| Chainable | yes | manual | yes |
| Pruning | with utility | auto-preset | auto-preset |

## Which style to use?

Start with **Batch (Series)** style unless you have a specific need for incremental processing or real-time streaming.

- Use **[Batch](/guide/styles/batch)** when you have a complete historical dataset and need to calculate indicators once. Fastest and simplest.
- Use **[Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer)** when bars arrive one at a time and you need incremental processing without the overhead of a full hub infrastructure.
- Use **[Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream)** when you need coordinated, automatic updates across multiple chained indicators from a live data feed.

## Getting started

See [Getting started](/guide/getting-started) for installation, first steps, and example usage.
