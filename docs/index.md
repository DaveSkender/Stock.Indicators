**Stock Indicators for .NET** is a C# [library package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FacioQuo.Stock.Indicators) that transforms financial market price data into technical indicators. Get moving averages, Relative Strength Index, Stochastic Oscillator, Parabolic SAR, and [many other indicators](/indicators).

Build trading algorithms, charting applications, machine learning models, or market analysis tools with your own [OHLCV](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) price bars from any market: equities, commodities, forex, or cryptocurrencies.

::: tip ✨ v3 adds streaming support
Our new **`FacioQuo.Stock.Indicators`** NuGet library, formerly `Skender.Stock.Indicators`, adds stream hub and buffer list style indicators to enable your incremental and real-time price data scenarios.

## Industry-standard indicators with extensibility

Access a comprehensive library of battle-tested technical indicators used by traders worldwide. Extend functionality by creating your own [custom indicators](/guide/customization) that integrate seamlessly with the library.

<ClientOnly>
  <LandingCharts />
</ClientOnly>

## Simple, intuitive API

```csharp
// example: calculate 20-period simple moving average
IReadOnlyList<SmaResult> results = bars.ToSma(20);
```

See more [usage examples](/guide/getting-started#example-usage).

## Three styles to meet your needs

The library provides three indicator styles for different use cases.

| Style | Best for |
| ----- | -------- |
| [Batch (Series)](/guide/styles/batch) | Once-and-done bulk calculations on complete datasets |
| [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) | Self-managed incremental data, sequential processing |
| [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) | Live data feeds with coordinated multi-indicator updates |

See the [Indicator styles](/guide/styles/) guide for a full feature comparison.

## Incrementally add data with buffer lists <Badge type="warning" text="preview" />

For scenarios where bars arrive one at a time, buffer lists provide efficient incremental processing without recalculating the entire history.

```csharp
// create list
SmaList smaList = new(lookbackPeriods: 20);

// add new bars incrementally
smaList.Add(newBar);
```

Buffer lists maintain internal state and automatically manage the warmup period, making them ideal for basic live data feeds and incremental updates.

## Streaming hubs with observer patterns <Badge type="warning" text="preview" />

Hubs provides a reactive, subscription-based pattern for streaming market data with automatic cascading calculations for advances scenarios.

### Example 1: Chained hubs

```csharp
// create provider and subscribe observers
BarHub barHub = new(); // provider
SmaHub smaHub = barHub.ToSmaHub(20);
RsiHub rsiHub = smaHub.ToRsiHub(14);  // RSI of SMA

// publish bars - observers auto-update in cascade
barHub.Add(newBar);

// consume downstream hubs indicators
IReadOnlyList<RsiResult> results = rsiHub.Results;
```

### Example 2: signal-based strategy

```csharp
// create provider and subscribe observers
BarHub barHub = new();
EmaHub emaFast = barHub.ToEmaHub(50);
EmaHub emaSlow = barHub.ToEmaHub(200);

// add bars to barHub (from stream)
barHub.Add(newBar);
// and the 2 EmaHubs will be in sync

if(emaFast.Results[^2].Ema < emaSlow.Results[^2].Ema
&& emaFast.Results[^1].Ema > emaSlow.Results[^1].Ema)
{
    // cross over occurred
}
```

The observer cascade ensures that when a new bar arrives, all chained indicators update automatically in the correct sequence.

See the [guide](/guide/getting-started) and the [full list of indicators and overlays](/indicators) for more information.

## Powerful chaining for advanced analysis

Chain indicators together for sophisticated technical analysis: create indicators of indicators, calculate [slope](/indicators/slope) (direction) of any result, or apply [moving averages](/indicators/sma) to indicator outputs.

```csharp
// example: calculate RSI of On-Balance Volume
IReadOnlyList<RsiResult> results
  = bars.ToObv()
        .ToRsi(14);

// example: use custom candle price variants
IReadOnlyList<EmaResult> results
  = bars.Use(CandlePart.HL2)
        .ToEma(20);
```

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Optimized for modern .NET frameworks

Our [NuGet library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FacioQuo.Stock.Indicators) directly targets all actively [supported Microsoft .NET platforms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) for peak performance.
