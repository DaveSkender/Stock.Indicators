**Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

This project is simpler than most, so it's a good place to start contributing to the open source community, even if you're a newbie.

We are accepting these sorts of changes and requests:

- Bug reports and fixes
- Usability improvements
- Documentation updates
- New reputable "by the book" indicators and overlays

We are not accepting things that should be done in your own wrapper code:

- Personal customizations and preferences
- Modified or augmented outputs that are not instrinsic

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

If you are reporting a bug or suspect a problem, please [submit an Issue](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/issues) with a detailed description of the problem + include steps to reproduce, code samples, and any reference materials.  For new features, add a new Issue with the `enhancement` label.

## Project management

- Planned work is managed in [the backlog](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/projects/1).
- Work items are primarily [entered as Notes](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-notes-to-a-project-board) (not Issues), except where an issue or feature is user reported.  With that said, Notes can be converted to Issues if in-progress and collaborative discussion is needed.
- Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions) area for general ideation and unrelated questions.

## Developing

- Read this first: [A Step by Step Guide to Making Your First GitHub Contribution](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940).  I also have a discussion [on Forking](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/503) if you have questions.
- If you are adding a new indicator, the easiest way to do this is to copy the folder of an existing indicator and rename everything using the same naming conventions and taxonomy.  All new indicators should include unit and performance tests.
- Do not comingle multiple contributions.  Please keep changes small and separate.

## Testing

- Review the `tests/indicators` folder for examples of unit tests.  Just copy one of these.
- New indicators should be tested against manually calculated, proven, accurate results.  It is helpful to include your manual calculations spreadsheet in the appropriate indicator folder when [submitting changes](#submitting-changes).
- Historical Stock Quotes are automatically added to unit test methods.  A `Data.Quotes.xlsx` Excel file is included in the `tests/_common` folder that is an exact copy of what is used in the unit tests.  Use this for your manual calculations to ensure that it is correct.  Do not commit changes to this Excel file.
- We expect all unit tests to execute successfully and all Errors and Warning resolved before you submit your code.
- Failed builds or unit testing will block acceptance of your Pull Request when submitting changes.

### Performance benchmarking

Running the `Tests.Performance` console application in `Release` mode will produce performance data that we periodically include in the repo documentation.  You can find the latest results [here](https://daveskender.github.io/Stock.Indicators/performance/).

```bash
# run all performance benchmarks
dotnet run -c Release

# run individual performance benchmark
dotnet run -c Release --filter *.GetAdx
```

## Documentation

This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) construction with Front Matter.
The documentation site is in the `docs` folder.  Build the site locally to test that it works properly.
See [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) for initial setup instructions.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

# then open site on http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

When adding or updating indicators:

- Add or update the indicator documentation `/docs/_indicators` files.
- Page image assets go in the `/docs/assets/` folder.

## Submitting changes

By submitting changes to this repo you are also acknowledging and agree to the terms in both the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1](https://developercertificate.org) and the [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).  These are standard open-source terms and conditions.

When ready, submit a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests)).
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for most changes.

After a Pull Request is reviewed, accepted, and [squash] merged to `main`, we may batch changes before publishing a new package version to the [public NuGet repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skender.Stock.Indicators).  Please be patient with turnaround time.

## Code reviews and administration

If you want to contribute administratively, do code reviews, or provide general user support, we're also currently seeking a few core people to help.  Please [contact us](#contact-info) if interested.

## Standards and design guidelines

- [.NET Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines)
- [NuGet Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/nuget)
- [Semantic Version 2.0](https://semver.org)

## Versioning

We use the `GitVersion` tool for [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).  It is mostly auto generated in the [Azure DevOps build](https://dev.azure.com/skender/Stock.Indicators/_build?definitionId=21).

Type | Format | Description
------------ | ------ | -----------
Major | `x.-.-` | A significant deviation with major breaking changes.
Minor | `-.x.-` | A new feature, usually new non-breaking change, such as adding an indicator.  Minor breaking changes may occur here and are denoted in the [release notes](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/releases).
Patch | `-.-.x` | A small bug fix, chore, or documentation change.
Increment | `-.-.-+x` | Intermediate commits between releases.

This only needs to be done on the merge to `main` when the Pull Request is committed, so your feature branch does not need to include this as it will get squashed anyway.

- Adding `+semver: major` as a PR merge commit message will increment the major x.-.- element
- Adding `+semver: minor` as a PR merge commit message will increment the minor -.x.- element
- Adding `+semver: patch` as a PR merge commit message will increment the minor -.-.x element.  Patch element auto-increments, so you'd only need to do this to override the next value.

A Git `tag`, in accordance with the above schema, is introduced automatically after deploying to the public NuGet package manager and is reflected in the [Releases](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/releases).
