Created by Alexander Elder, the [Force Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_index) depicts volume-based buying and selling pressure based on the change in price.
[[Discuss] &#128172;]({{site.github.repository_url}}/discussions/382 "Community discussion about this indicator")

![chart for {{page.title}}]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.image}})

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IEnumerable<ForceIndexResult> results =
  quotes.GetForceIndex(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

**`lookbackPeriods`** _`int`_ - Lookback window (`N`) for the EMA of Force Index.  Must be greater than 0 and is commonly 2 or 13 (shorter/longer view).  Default is 2.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+100` for `2Ã—N` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the [warmup and convergence]({{site.github.repository_url}}/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique for EMA, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ForceIndexResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods for will be `null` since they cannot be calculated.

>&#9886; **Convergence warning**: The first `N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### ForceIndexResult

**`Date`** _`DateTime`_ - Date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`ForceIndex`** _`double`_ - Force Index

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `ForceIndex` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetForceIndex(..)
    .GetEma(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
