```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IEnumerable<ElderRayResult> results =
  quotes.GetElderRay(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

**`lookbackPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`N`) for the underlying EMA evaluation.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 13.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2Ã—N` or `N+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the [warmup and convergence]({{site.github.repository_url}}/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ElderRayResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` indicator values since there's not enough data to calculate.

>&#9886; **Convergence warning**: The first `N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### ElderRayResult

**`Date`** _`DateTime`_ - Date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`Ema`** _`double`_ - Exponential moving average

**`BullPower`** _`double`_ - Bull Power

**`BearPower`** _`double`_ - Bear Power

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `(BullPower+BearPower)` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetElderRay(..)
    .GetEma(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
