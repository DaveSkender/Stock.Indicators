```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<ElderRayResult> results =
  quotes.GetElderRay(lookbackPeriods);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) for the underlying EMA evaluation.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 13.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2Ã—N` or `N+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ElderRayResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` indicator values since there's not enough data to calculate.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### ElderRayResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Ema` | decimal | Exponential moving average of Close price
| `BullPower` | decimal | Bull Power
| `BearPower` | decimal | Bear Power

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate ElderRay(13)
IEnumerable<ElderRayResult> results
  = quotes.GetElderRay(13);
```
