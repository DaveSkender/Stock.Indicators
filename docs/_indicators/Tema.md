# {{ page.title }}

Created by Patrick G. Mulloy, the [Triple exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_exponential_moving_average) is a faster multi-smoothed EMA of the Close price over a lookback window.
Note: TEMA is often confused with the alternative [TRIX]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Trix/#content) oscillator.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<TemaResult> results =
  quotes.GetTema(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 0.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `4×N` or `3×N+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the convergence periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `3×N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<TemaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  Also note that we are using the proper [weighted variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_exponential_moving_average) for TEMA.  If you prefer the unweighted raw 3 EMAs value, please use the `Ema3` output from the [TRIX]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Trix#content) oscillator instead.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `3×N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### TemaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Tema` | double | Triple exponential moving average

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetTema(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Tema` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetTema(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
