```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<HtlResult> results =
  quotes.GetHtTrendline();
```

## Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `100` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<HtlResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `6` periods will have `null` values for `SmoothPrice` since there's not enough data to calculate.

> :hourglass: **Convergence warning**: The first `100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### HtlResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Trendline` | double | HT Trendline
| `SmoothPrice` | double | Weighted moving average of `(H+L)/2` price

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HLC3)
    .GetHtTrendline(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Trendline` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetHtTrendline(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
