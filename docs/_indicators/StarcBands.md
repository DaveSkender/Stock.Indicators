Created by Manning Stoller, the [Stoller Average Range Channel (STARC) Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/starc.asp), are price ranges based on an SMA centerline and ATR band widths.  See also <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Keltner/#content" rel="nofollow">Keltner Channels</a> for an EMA centerline equivalent.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IEnumerable<StarcBandsResult> results =
  quotes.GetStarcBands(smaPeriods, multiplier, atrPeriods);
```

## Parameters

**`smaPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of lookback periods (`S`) for the center line moving average.  Must be greater than 1 to calculate and is typically between 5 and 10.

**`multiplier`** _`double`_ - ATR Multiplier. Must be greater than 0.  Default is 2.

**`atrPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of lookback periods (`A`) for the Average True Range.  Must be greater than 1 to calculate and is typically the same value as `smaPeriods`.  Default is 10.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `S` or `A+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the [warmup and convergence]({{site.github.repository_url}}/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `A+150` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<StarcBandsResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate, where `N` is the greater of `S` or `A`.

>&#9886; **Convergence warning**: The first `A+150` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### StarcBandsResult

**`Date`** _`DateTime`_ - Date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`UpperBand`** _`decimal`_ - Upper STARC band

**`Centerline`** _`decimal`_ - SMA of price

**`LowerBand`** _`decimal`_ - Lower STARC band

## Chaining

This indicator is not chain-enabled and must be generated from `quotes`.  It **cannot** be used for further processing by other chain-enabled indicators.
