[Moving Average Envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_envelope) is a price band channel overlay that is offset from the moving average of price.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<MaEnvelopeResult> results =
  quotes.GetMaEnvelopes(lookbackPeriods, percentOffset, movingAverageType);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 1.
| `percentOffset` | double | Percent offset for envelope width.  Example: 3.5% would be entered as 3.5 (not 0.035).  Must be greater than 0.  Typical values range from 2 to 10.  Default is 2.5.
| `movingAverageType` | MaType | Type of moving average (e.g. SMA, EMA, HMA).  See [MaType options](#matype-options) below.  Default is `MaType.SMA`.

### Historical quotes requirements

See links in the supported [MaType options](#matype-options) section below for details on the inherited requirements for `quotes` and `lookbackPeriods`.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

### MaType options

These are the supported moving average types:

| type | description
|-- |--
| `MaType.ALMA` | [Arnaud Legoux Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Alma/#content)
| `MaType.DEMA` | [Double Exponential Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Dema/#content)
| `MaType.EPMA` | [Endpoint Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Epma/#content)
| `MaType.EMA` | [Exponential Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Ema/#content)
| `MaType.HMA` | [Hull Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Hma/#content)
| `MaType.SMA` | [Simple Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Sma/#content) (default)
| `MaType.SMMA` | [Smoothed Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Smma/#content)
| `MaType.TEMA` | [Triple Exponential Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Tema/#content)
| `MaType.WMA` | [Weighted Moving Average]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Wma/#content)

> :warning:  **Warning**: For ALMA, default values are used for `offset` and `sigma`.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<MaEnvelopeResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate; the quantity will vary based on the `movingAverageType` specified.

> :hourglass: **Convergence warning**: Some moving average variants have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.  See links in the supported [MaType options](#matype-options) section above for more information.

### MaEnvelopeResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Centerline` | double | Moving average for `N` lookback periods
| `UpperEnvelope` | double | Upper envelope band
| `LowerEnvelope` | double | Lower envelope band

The moving average `Centerline` is based on the `movingAverageType` type specified.

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HLC3)
    .GetMaEnvelopes(..);
```

Results **cannot** be further chained with additional transforms.
