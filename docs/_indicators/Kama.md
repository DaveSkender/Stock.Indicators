```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<KamaResult> results =
  quotes.GetKama(erPeriods, fastPeriods, slowPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `erPeriods` | int | Number of Efficiency Ratio (volatility) periods (`E`).  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 10.
| `fastPeriods` | int | Number of Fast EMA periods.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 2.
| `slowPeriods` | int | Number of Slow EMA periods.  Must be greater than `fastPeriods`.  Default is 30.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `6×E` or `E+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the convergence periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `10×E` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<KamaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `E-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `10×E` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### KamaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `ER`   | double | Efficiency Ratio is the fractal efficiency of price changes
| `Kama` | double | Kaufman's adaptive moving average

More about Efficiency Ratio: ER fluctuates between 0 and 1, but these extremes are the exception, not the norm. ER would be 1 if prices moved up or down consistently over the `erPeriods` window. ER would be zero if prices are unchanged over the `erPeriods` window.

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetKama(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Kama` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetKama(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
