Created by Bill Williams, the Awesome Oscillator (aka Super AO) is a measure of the gap between a fast and slow period modified moving average.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<AwesomeResult> results =
  quotes.GetAwesome(fastPeriods, slowPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `fastPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`F`) for the faster moving average.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 5.
| `slowPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`S`) for the slower moving average.  Must be greater than `fastPeriods`.  Default is 34.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `S` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<AwesomeResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first period `S-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### AwesomeResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Oscillator` | double | Awesome Oscillator
| `Normalized` | double | `100 ร Oscillator รท (median price)`

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetAwesome(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Oscillator` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetAwesome(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
