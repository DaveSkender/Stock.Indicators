Created by Munehisa Homma, [Heikin-Ashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart#Heikin-Ashi_candlesticks) is a modified candlestick pattern that uses prior day for smoothing.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<HeikinAshiResult> results =
  quotes.GetHeikinAshi();
```

## Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least two periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods; however, more is typically provided since this is a chartable candlestick pattern.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<HeikinAshiResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first period will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.
- `HeikinAshiResult` is based on `IQuote`, so it can be used as a direct replacement for `quotes`.

### HeikinAshiResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Open` | decimal | Modified open price
| `High` | decimal | Modified high price
| `Low` | decimal | Modified low price
| `Close` | decimal | Modified close price
| `Volume` | decimal | Volume (same as `quotes`)

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)
- .ToQuotes() to convert to a `Quote` collection.  Example:

  ```csharp
  IEnumerable<Quote> results = quotes.GetHeikinAshi().ToQuotes();
  ```

See [Utilities and Helpers]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#utilities-for-indicator-results) for more information.

## Chaining

Results are based in `IQuote` and can be further used in any indicator.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetHeikinAshi(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
