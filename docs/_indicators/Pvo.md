# {{ page.title }}

The [Percentage Volume Oscillator](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:percentage_volume_oscillator_pvo) is a simple oscillator view of two converging/diverging exponential moving averages of Volume.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<PvoResult> results =
  quotes.GetPvo(fastPeriods, slowPeriods, signalPeriods);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `fastPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`F`) for the faster moving average.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 12.
| `slowPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`S`) for the slower moving average.  Must be greater than `fastPeriods`.  Default is 26.
| `signalPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`P`) for the moving average of PVO.  Must be greater than or equal to 0.  Default is 9.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2Ã—(S+P)` or `S+P+100` worth of `quotes`, whichever is more.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `S+P+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<PvoResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `S-1` slow periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `S+P+250` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### PvoResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Pvo` | decimal | Normalized difference between two Volume moving averages
| `Signal` | decimal | Moving average of the `Pvo` line
| `Histogram` | decimal | Gap between of the `Pvo` and `Signal` line

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate Pvo(12,26,9)
IEnumerable<PvoResult> results = quotes.GetPvo(12,26,9);
```
