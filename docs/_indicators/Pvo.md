```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IEnumerable<PvoResult> results =
  quotes.GetPvo(fastPeriods, slowPeriods, signalPeriods);
```

## Parameters

**`fastPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`F`) for the faster moving average.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 12.

**`slowPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`S`) for the slower moving average.  Must be greater than `fastPeriods`.  Default is 26.

**`signalPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`P`) for the moving average of PVO.  Must be greater than or equal to 0.  Default is 9.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2×(S+P)` or `S+P+100` worth of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the convergence periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `S+P+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<PvoResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `S-1` slow periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

>&#9886; **Convergence warning**: The first `S+P+250` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### PvoResult

**`Date`** _`DateTime`_ - Date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`Pvo`** _`double`_ - Normalized difference between two Volume moving averages

**`Signal`** _`double`_ - Moving average of the `Pvo` line

**`Histogram`** _`double`_ - Gap between of the `Pvo` and `Signal` line

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Pvo` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetPvo(..)
    .GetSlope(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
