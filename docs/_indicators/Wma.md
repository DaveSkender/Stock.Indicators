```csharp
// usage (with Close price)
IEnumerable<WmaResult> results =
  quotes.GetWma(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the lookback window.  Must be greater than 0.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<WmaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### WmaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Wma` | double | Weighted moving average for `N` lookback periods

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetWma(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Wma` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetWma(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```
