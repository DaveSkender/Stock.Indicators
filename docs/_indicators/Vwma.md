```csharp
// legacy usage
IEnumerable<VwmaResult> results =
  quotes.GetVwma(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 0.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<VwmaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values for `Vwma` since there's not enough data to calculate.

### VwmaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Vwma` | double | Volume Weighted Moving Average for `N` lookback periods

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#utilities-for-indicator-results) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Vwma` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetVwma(..)
    .GetRsi(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
