# {{ page.title }}

Created by Larry Williams, the [Williams %R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_%25R) momentum indicator is a stochastic oscillator with scale of -100 to 0.  It is exactly the same as the Fast variant of [Stochastic Oscillator]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Stoch/#content), but with a different scaling.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<WilliamsResult> results =
  quotes.GetWilliamsR(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the lookback period.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 14.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<WilliamsResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes when not chained from another indicator.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` Oscillator values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### WilliamsResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `WilliamsR` | double | Oscillator over prior `N` lookback periods

### Utilities

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and Helpers]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#utilities-for-indicator-results) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `WilliamsR` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetWilliamsR(..)
    .GetSlope(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

:warning: **Warning:** fewer results are returned from chained indicators because unusable warmup period `null` values are removed.
