```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<AdlResult> results =
  quotes.GetAdl();
```

## Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least two historical quotes to cover the warmup periods; however, since this is a trendline, more is recommended.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<AdlResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.

### AdlResult

**`Timestamp`** _`DateTime`_ - date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`MoneyFlowMultiplier`** _`double`_ - Money Flow Multiplier

**`MoneyFlowVolume`** _`double`_ - Money Flow Volume

**`Adl`** _`double`_ - Accumulation Distribution Line (ADL)

> &#128681; **Warning**: absolute values in ADL and MFV are somewhat meaningless.  Use with caution.

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and helpers]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#utilities-for-indicator-results) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Adl` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetAdl()
    .GetRsi(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
