Created by J. Welles Wilder, True Range and [Average True Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_true_range) is a measure of volatility that captures gaps and limits between periods.

```csharp
// standard usage
IEnumerable<AtrResult> results =
  quotes.GetAtr(lookbackPeriods);

// ATR with custom moving average
IEnumerable<SmmaResult> results =
  quotes.GetTr().GetSmma(lookbackPeriods);

// raw True Range (TR) only
IEnumerable<TrResult> results =
  quote.GetTr();
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) to consider.  Must be greater than 1.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+100` periods of `quotes` to cover the convergence periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<AtrResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` values for ATR since there's not enough data to calculate.

> :hourglass: **Convergence warning**: The first `N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### AtrResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Tr` | double | True Range for current period
| `Atr` | double | Average True Range
| `Atrp` | double | Average True Range Percent is `(ATR/Price)*100`.  This normalizes so it can be compared to other stocks.

- [.Find(lookupDate)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#find-indicator-result-by-date)

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Atrp` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetAtr(..)
    .GetSlope(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
