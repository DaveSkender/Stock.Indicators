# {{ page.title }}

[Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) shows how strongly one asset's price responds to systemic volatility of the entire market.  [Upside Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_beta) (Beta+) and [Downside Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downside_beta) (Beta-), [popularized by Harry M. Markowitz](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bh4c8h), are also included.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<BetaResult> results = quotesEval
  .GetBeta(quotesMarket, lookbackPeriods, type);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `quotesMarket` | IEnumerable\<[TQuote]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes)\> | Historical [market] Quotes data should be at any consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  This `market` quotes will be used to establish the baseline.
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the lookback window.  Must be greater than 0 to calculate; however we suggest a larger period for statistically appropriate sample size and especially when using Beta +/-.
| `type` | BetaType | Type of Beta to calculate.  Default is `BetaType.Standard`. See [BetaType options](#betatype-options) below.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotesEval` to cover the warmup periods.  You must have at least the same matching date elements of `quotesMarket`.  Exception will be thrown if not matched.  Historical price quotes should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

#### BetaType options

| type | description
|-- |--
| `Standard` | Standard Beta only.  Uses all historical quotes.
| `Up` | Upside Beta only.  Uses historical quotes from market up bars only.
| `Down` | Downside Beta only.  Uses historical quotes from market down bars only.
| `All` | Returns all of the above.  Use this option if you want `Ratio` and `Convexity` values returned.  Note: 3× slower to calculate.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<BetaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### BetaResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Beta` | double | Beta coefficient based on `N` lookback periods
| `BetaUp` | double | Beta+ (Up Beta)
| `BetaDown` | double | Beta- (Down Beta)
| `Ratio` | double | Beta ratio is `BetaUp/BetaDown`
| `Convexity` | double | Beta convexity is <code>(BetaUp-BetaDown)<sup>2</sup></code>
| `ReturnsEval` | double | Returns of evaluated quotes (`R`)
| `ReturnsMrkt` | double | Returns of market quotes (`Rm`)

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotesEval
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetBeta(quotesMarket.Use(CandlePart.HL2), ..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Beta` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotesEval
    .GetBeta(quotesMarket, ..)
    .GetSlope(..);
```

## Pro tips

- Financial institutions often depict a single number for Beta on their sites.  To get that same long-term Beta value, use 5 years of monthly bars for `quotes` and a value of 60 for `lookbackPeriods`.  If you only have daily bars, use the [quotes.Aggregate(PeriodSize.Monthly)]({{site.baseurl}}/utilities#resize-quote-history) utility to convert it.
- [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)) is calculated as `R – Rf – Beta (Rm - Rf)`, where `Rf` is the risk-free rate.
