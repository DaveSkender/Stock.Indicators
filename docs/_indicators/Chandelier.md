Created by Charles Le Beau, the [Chandelier Exit](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:chandelier_exit) is an adjusted Average True Range (ATR) offset from price that is is typically used for stop-loss and can be computed for both long or short types.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<ChandelierResult> results =
  quotes.GetChandelier(lookbackPeriods, multiplier, type);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) for the lookback evaluation.  Default is 22.
| `multiplier` | double | Multiplier number must be a positive value.  Default is 3.
| `type` | ChandelierType | Direction of exit.  See [ChandelierType options](#chandeliertype-options) below.  Default is `ChandelierType.Long`.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+1` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

### ChandelierType options

| type | description
|-- |--
| `ChandelierType.Long` | Intended as stop loss value for long positions. (default)
| `ChandelierType.Short` | Intended as stop loss value for short positions.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ChandelierResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` Chandelier values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### ChandelierResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `ChandelierExit` | double | Exit line

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Atrp` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetChandelier(..)
    .GetEma(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.
