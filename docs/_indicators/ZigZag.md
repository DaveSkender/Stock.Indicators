[Zig Zag](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:zigzag) is a price chart overlay that simplifies the up and down movements and transitions based on a percent change smoothing threshold.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<ZigZagResult> results =
  quotes.GetZigZag(endType, percentChange);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `endType` | EndType | Determines whether `Close` or `High/Low` are used to measure percent change.  See [EndType options](#endtype-options) below.  Default is `EndType.Close`.
| `percentChange` | decimal | Percent change required to establish a line endpoint.  Example: 3.5% would be entered as 3.5 (not 0.035).  Must be greater than 0.  Typical values range from 3 to 10.  Default is 5.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least two periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods, but notably more is needed to be useful.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

### EndType options

| type | description
|-- |--
| `EndType.Close` | Percent change measured from `Close` price (default)
| `EndType.HighLow` | Percent change measured from `High` and `Low` price

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ZigZagResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- If you do not supply enough points to cover the percent change, there will be no Zig Zag points or lines.
- The first line segment starts after the first confirmed point; ZigZag values before the first confirmed point will be `null`.
- The last line segment is an approximation as the direction is indeterminate.

:warning: **Warning**:  depending on the specified `endType`, the indicator cannot be initialized if the first `Quote` in `quotes` has a `High`,`Low`, or `Close` value of 0 (zero).

:paintbrush: **Repaint Warning**: the last line segement will always be redrawn back to the last known pivot.  Do not attempt to calculate incremental values since previous values may change based on newer quotes.

### ZigZagResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `ZigZag` | decimal | Zig Zag line for `percentChange`
| `PointType` | string | Zig Zag endpoint type (`H` for high point, `L` for low point)
| `RetraceHigh` | decimal | Retrace line for high points
| `RetraceLow` | decimal | Retrace line for low points

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate 3% change ZIGZAG
IEnumerable<ZigZagResult> results
  = quotes.GetZigZag(EndType.Close,3);
```
