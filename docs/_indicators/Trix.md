# {{ page.title }}

Created by Jack Hutson, [TRIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trix_(technical_analysis)) is the rate of change for a 3 EMA smoothing of the Close price over a lookback window.  TRIX is often confused with [TEMA](../TripleEma#content).

```csharp
// usage for Trix
IEnumerable<TrixResult> results =
  quotes.GetTrix(lookbackPeriods);

// usage for Trix with Signal Line (shown above)
IEnumerable<TrixResult> results =
  quotes.GetTrix(lookbackPeriods, signalPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in each of the the exponential moving averages.  Must be greater than 0.
| `signalPeriods` | int | Optional.  Number of periods in the moving average of TRIX.  Must be greater than 0, if specified.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `4×N` or `3×N+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `3×N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is an `IEnumerable<TQuote>` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<TrixResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `3×N-3` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `3×N+250` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### TrixResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Ema3` | decimal | 3 EMAs of the Close price
| `Trix` | decimal | Rate of Change of 3 EMAs
| `Signal` | decimal | SMA of `Trix` based on `signalPeriods` periods, if specified

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your feed (your method)
IEnumerable<Quote> quotes = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate 20-period Trix
IEnumerable<TrixResult> results = quotes.GetTrix(14);
```
