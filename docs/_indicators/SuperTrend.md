Created by Oliver Seban, the SuperTrend indicator attempts to determine the primary trend of prices by using [Average True Range (ATR)]({{site.baseurl}}/indicators/Atr/#content) band thresholds around an HL2 midline.  It can indicate a buy/sell signal or a trailing stop when the trend changes.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IEnumerable<SuperTrendResult> results =
  quotes.GetSuperTrend(lookbackPeriods, multiplier);
```

## Parameters

**`lookbackPeriods`** _`int`_ - Number of periods (`N`) for the ATR evaluation.  Must be greater than 1 and is usually set between 7 and 14.  Default is 10.

**`multiplier`** _`double`_ - Multiplier sets the ATR band width.  Must be greater than 0 and is usually set around 2 to 3.  Default is 3.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+100` periods of `quotes` to cover the [warmup and convergence]({{site.github.repository_url}}/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` periods prior to the intended usage date for optimal precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<SuperTrendResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` SuperTrend values since there's not enough data to calculate.

>&#9886; **Convergence warning**: the line segment before the first reversal and the first `N+100` periods are unreliable due to an initial guess of trend direction and precision convergence for the underlying ATR values.

### SuperTrendResult

**`Date`** _`DateTime`_ - Date from evaluated `TQuote`

**`SuperTrend`** _`decimal`_ - SuperTrend line contains both Upper and Lower segments

**`UpperBand`** _`decimal`_ - Upper band only (bearish/red)

**`LowerBand`** _`decimal`_ - Lower band only (bullish/green)

`UpperBand` and `LowerBand` values are provided to differentiate bullish vs bearish trends and to clearly demark trend reversal.  `SuperTrend` is the contiguous combination of both upper and lower line data.

## Chaining

This indicator is not chain-enabled and must be generated from `quotes`.  It **cannot** be used for further processing by other chain-enabled indicators.
