# {{ page.title }}

Created by J. Welles Wilder, the [Relative Strength Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index) measures strength of the winning/losing streak over `N` lookback periods on a scale of 0 to 100, to depict overbought and oversold conditions.

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<RsiResult> results =
  quotes.GetRsi(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) in the lookback period.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 14.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+100` periods of `quotes` to cover the convergence periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `10×N` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<RsiResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

:hourglass: **Convergence Warning**: The first `10×N` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### RsiResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Rsi` | double | RSI over prior `N` lookback periods

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .GetRsi(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Rsi` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .GetRsi(..)
    .GetSlope(..);
```
