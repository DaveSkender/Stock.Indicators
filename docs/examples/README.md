To help you get started, here are a few minimalist .NET 6.0 C# projects that you can review.  They are complete working examples.

- `ConsoleApp` is a minimalist example of how to use the library (start here)
- `Backtest` is a slightly more complicated example of how to analyze results
- `CustomIndicatorsLibrary` shows how you can [create your own custom indicators]({{site.baseurl}}/custom-indicators/#content)
- `CustomIndicatorsUsage` shows how you'd use a custom indicator just like any other in the main library

For more information on how to use this library overall, see the [Guide and Pro Tips]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#content).

To run the sample projects:

1. [Download the ZIP file](Skender.Stock.Indicators-Examples.zip) and extract contents
2. Open `Examples.sln` in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
3. Review the code in the `Program.cs` file
4. Run the `ConsoleApp` by any one of the following methods:
   - pressing the `CTRL+F5` key
   - execute `dotnet run` CLI command in the `ConsoleApp` folder
   - clicking the play button
