# Connect to an external quote API

To get connected to an external quote API in this console test project, you have to add [your own Alpaca key and secret information](https://alpaca.markets/docs/market-data/getting-started/#creating-an-alpaca-account-and-finding-your-api-keys) to your local environment variables.

Run the following command line items to set, after replacing the secret and key values.

```bash
// use your own keys
setx AlpacaApiKey "ALPACA_API_KEY"
