# Renko Chart

The [Renko Chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renko_chart) is a Japanese price transformed candlestick pattern that uses "bricks" to show a defined increment of change over a non-linear time series.  Transitions can use either `Close` or `High/Low` price values.  An ATR variant is also provided where brick size is determined by current Average True Range values.

<IndicatorChartPanel indicator-key="Renko" />

```csharp
// C# usage syntax (fixed brick size)
IReadOnlyList<RenkoResult> results =
  quotes.ToRenko(brickSize, endType);

// C# usage syntax (ATR-derived brick size — Series only)
IReadOnlyList<RenkoResult> results =
  quotes.ToRenkoAtr(atrPeriods, endType);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `endType` | EndType | See [EndType options](#endtype-options) below.  Applies to both variants.  Default is `EndType.Close` |

### Fixed brick size

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `brickSize` | decimal | Brick size.  Must be greater than 0. |

### ATR-derived brick size

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `atrPeriods` | int | Number of lookback periods (`A`) for ATR evaluation.  Must be greater than 0. |

### Historical quotes requirements

**Fixed brick size**: You must have at least two periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods; however, more is typically provided since this is a chartable candlestick pattern.

**ATR-derived brick size**: You must have at least `A+100` periods of `quotes`.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-quotes) for more information.

### EndType options

**`EndType.Close`** - Brick change threshold measured from `Close` price (default)

**`EndType.HighLow`** - Brick change threshold measured from `High` and `Low` price

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<RenkoResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- `RenkoResult` is based on `IQuote`, so it can be used as a direct replacement for `quotes`.

::: warning
Unlike most indicators in this library, this indicator DOES NOT return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.  Renko bricks are added to the results once the `brickSize` change is achieved.  For example, if it takes 3 days for a $2.50 price change to occur an entry is made on the third day while the first two are skipped.  If a period change occurs at multiples of `brickSize`, multiple bricks are drawn with the same `Timestamp`.  See [online documentation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renkochart.asp) for more information.
:::

::: warning 🖌️ ATR repaint warning
When using the `ToRenkoAtr()` variant, the last [Average True Range (ATR)](/indicators/Atr) value is used to set `brickSize`.  Since the ATR changes over time, historical bricks will be repainted as new periods are added or updated in `quotes`.
:::

### `RenkoResult`

Each result record represents one Renko brick.

**`Timestamp`** _`DateTime`_ - Formation date of brick(s)

**`Open`** _`decimal`_ - Brick open price

**`High`** _`decimal`_ - Highest high during elapsed quotes periods

**`Low`** _`decimal`_ - Lowest low during elapsed quotes periods

**`Close`** _`decimal`_ - Brick close price

**`Volume`** _`decimal`_ - Sum of Volume over elapsed quotes periods

**`IsUp`** _`bool`_ - Direction of brick (true=up,false=down)

::: warning
When multiple bricks are drawn from a single `quote` period, the extra information about `High` and `Low` wicks and `Volume` is potentially confusing to interpret.  `High` and `Low` wicks will be the same across the multiple bricks; and `Volume` is portioning evenly across the number of bricks.  For example, if within one `quote` period 3 bricks are drawn, the `Volume` for each brick will be `(sum of quotes Volume since last brick) / 3`.

## Chaining

Results are based in `IQuote` and can be further used in any indicator.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .ToRenko(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/batch#chaining-indicators) for more.

## Streaming

**Fixed brick size only** — Streaming implementations are available for the fixed brick size variant only.

Use a `BufferList` for incremental processing:

```csharp
RenkoList buffer = new(brickSize, endType);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating incremental data
{
  buffer.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<RenkoResult> results = buffer;
```

Subscribe to a `QuoteHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
QuoteHub quoteHub = new();
RenkoHub observer = quoteHub.ToRenkoHub(brickSize);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  quoteHub.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<RenkoResult> results = observer.Results;
```

::: warning
`ToRenkoAtr()` does not support streaming.
The ATR brick size is derived from the full dataset and changes as new quotes are added, making incremental output undefined.
Use the Series implementation with periodic recalculation instead.
