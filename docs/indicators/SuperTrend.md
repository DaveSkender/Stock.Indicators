# SuperTrend

Created by Oliver Seban, the SuperTrend indicator attempts to determine the primary trend of prices by using [Average True Range (ATR)](/indicators/Atr) band thresholds around an HL2 midline.  It can indicate a buy/sell signal or a trailing stop when the trend changes.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<SuperTrendResult> results =
  quotes.ToSuperTrend(lookbackPeriods, multiplier);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) for the ATR evaluation.  Must be greater than 1 and is usually set between 7 and 14.  Default is 10. |
| `multiplier` | double | Multiplier sets the ATR band width.  Must be greater than 0 and is usually set around 2 to 3.  Default is 3. |

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N+100` periods of `quotes` to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` periods prior to the intended usage date for optimal precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<SuperTrendResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` SuperTrend values since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning ⚞ Convergence warning
the line segment before the first reversal and the first `N+100` periods are unreliable due to an initial guess of trend direction and precision convergence for the underlying ATR values.

### `SuperTrendResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | DateTime | Date from evaluated `TQuote` |
| `SuperTrend` | decimal | SuperTrend line contains both Upper and Lower segments |
| `UpperBand` | decimal | Upper band only (bearish/red) |
| `LowerBand` | decimal | Lower band only (bullish/green) |

`UpperBand` and `LowerBand` values are provided to differentiate bullish vs bearish trends and to clearly demark trend reversal.  `SuperTrend` is the contiguous combination of both upper and lower line data.

## Chaining

This indicator is not chain-enabled and must be generated from `quotes`.  It **cannot** be used for further processing by other chain-enabled indicators.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
SuperTrendList superTrendList = new(lookbackPeriods, multiplier);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  superTrendList.Add(quote);
}

// based on `ICollection<SuperTrendResult>`
IReadOnlyList<SuperTrendResult> results = superTrendList;
```

Subscribe to a `QuoteHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
QuoteHub quoteHub = new();
SuperTrendHub observer = quoteHub.ToSuperTrendHub(lookbackPeriods, multiplier);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  quoteHub.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<SuperTrendResult> results = observer.Results;
```
