# Average Directional Index (ADX)

Created by J. Welles Wilder, the [Average Directional Movement Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_directional_movement_index) (ADX) is part of the Directional Movement system (commonly referred to as DMI). This system includes the Positive and Negative Directional Indicators (+DI and −DI), the Directional Index (DX), and ADX, and is used to measure the strength of price trends.

  <StockIndicatorChart indicator="Adx" withOverlay />
</ClientOnly>

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<AdxResult> results =
  bars.ToAdx(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) to consider.  Must be greater than 1.  Default is 14. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `2×N+100` periods of `bars` to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/facioquo/stock-indicators-dotnet/discussions/688) periods.  We generally recommend you use at least `2×N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<AdxResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `2×N-1` periods will have `null` values for `Adx` since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning 🚩 ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `2×N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### `AdxResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `Pdi` | _`double`_ | Plus Directional Index (+DI) |
| `Mdi` | _`double`_ | Minus Directional Index (-DI) |
| `Dx` | _`double`_ | Directional Index (DX) |
| `Adx` | _`double`_ | Average Directional Index (ADX) |
| `Adxr` | _`double`_ | Average Directional Index Rating (ADXR) |

- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(removePeriods)](/utilities/results#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and helpers](/utilities/) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Adx` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .ToAdx(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `bars` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations:

```csharp
AdxList adxList = new(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  adxList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<AdxResult>`
IReadOnlyList<AdxResult> results = adxList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
AdxHub observer = barHub.ToAdxHub(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<AdxResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
