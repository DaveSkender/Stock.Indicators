# Keltner Channels

Created by Chester W. Keltner, [Keltner Channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keltner_channel) are based on an EMA centerline and ATR band widths.  See also [STARC Bands](/indicators/starc-bands) for an SMA centerline equivalent.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<KeltnerResult> results =
  bars.ToKeltner(emaPeriods, multiplier, atrPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `emaPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of lookback periods (`E`) for the center line moving average.  Must be greater than 1 to calculate.  Default is 20. |
| `multiplier` | _`double`_ | ATR Multiplier. Must be greater than 0.  Default is 2. |
| `atrPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of lookback periods (`A`) for the Average True Range.  Must be greater than 1 to calculate.  Default is 10. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `2×N` or `N+100` periods of `bars`, whichever is more, where `N` is the greater of `E` or `A` periods, to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/facioquo/stock-indicators-dotnet/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<KeltnerResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning 🚩 ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `N+250` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### `KeltnerResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `UpperBand` | _`double`_ | Upper band of Keltner Channel |
| `Centerline` | _`double`_ | EMA of price |
| `LowerBand` | _`double`_ | Lower band of Keltner Channel |
| `Width` | _`double`_ | Width as percent of Centerline price.  `(UpperBand-LowerBand)/Centerline` |

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `Centerline` with other [chained indicators](/guide/chaining).

This indicator must be generated from `bars` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .ToKeltner(..);
```

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
KeltnerList keltnerList = new(emaPeriods, multiplier, atrPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  keltnerList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<KeltnerResult>`
IReadOnlyList<KeltnerResult> results = keltnerList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
KeltnerHub observer = barHub.ToKeltnerHub(emaPeriods, multiplier, atrPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<KeltnerResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
