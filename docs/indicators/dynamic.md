```csharp
// C# usage syntax (with Close price)
IReadOnlyList<DynamicResult> results =
  bars.ToDynamic(lookbackPeriods, kFactor);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 0. |
| `kFactor` | _`double`_ | Optional.  Range adjustment factor (`K`).  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 0.6 |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `2` periods of `bars`, to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/facioquo/stock-indicators-dotnet/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `4×N` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

### Pro tips

> Use a `kFactor` value of `1` if you do not want to adjust the `N` value.
>
> McGinley suggests that using a `K` value of 60% (0.6) allows you to use a `N` equivalent to other moving averages.  For example, DYNAMIC(20,0.6) is comparable to EMA(20); conversely, DYNAMIC(20,1) uses the raw 1:1 `N` value and is not equivalent.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<DynamicResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first period will have a `null` value since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning 🚩 ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `4×N` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### `DynamicResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `Dynamic` | _`double`_ | McGinley Dynamic |

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .ToDynamic(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Dynamic` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .ToDynamic(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
DynamicList dynamicList = new(lookbackPeriods, kFactor);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  dynamicList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<DynamicResult>`
IReadOnlyList<DynamicResult> results = dynamicList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
DynamicHub observer = barHub.ToDynamicHub(lookbackPeriods, kFactor);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<DynamicResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
