# ATR Trailing Stop

Created by Welles Wilder, the ATR Trailing Stop indicator attempts to determine the primary trend of Close prices by using [Average True Range (ATR)](/indicators/atr) band thresholds.  It can indicate a buy/sell signal or a trailing stop when the trend changes.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<AtrStopResult> results =
  bars.ToAtrStop(lookbackPeriods, multiplier, endType);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) for the ATR evaluation.  Must be greater than 1.  Default is 21. |
| `multiplier` | _`double`_ | Multiplier sets the ATR band width.  Must be greater than 0 and is usually set around 2 to 3.  Default is 3. |
| `endType` | _`EndType`_ | Determines whether `Close` or `High/Low` is used as basis for stop offset. Default is `EndType.Close`. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `N+100` periods of `bars` to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/facioquo/stock-indicators-dotnet/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` periods prior to the intended usage date for optimal precision.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<AtrStopResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` AtrStop values since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning 🚩 ⚞ Convergence warning
the line segment before the first reversal and the first `N+100` periods are unreliable due to an initial guess of trend direction and precision convergence for the underlying ATR values.

### `AtrStopResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `AtrStop` | _`double`_ | ATR Trailing Stop line contains both Upper and Lower segments |
| `BuyStop` | _`double`_ | Upper band only (green) |
| `SellStop` | _`double`_ | Lower band only (red) |
| `Atr` | _`double`_ | Average True Range |

`BuyStop` and `SellStop` values are provided to differentiate buy vs sell stop lines and to clearly demark trend reversal.  `AtrStop` is the contiguous combination of both upper and lower line data.

## Chaining

This indicator is not chain-enabled and must be generated from `bars`.  It **cannot** be used for further processing by other chain-enabled indicators.

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
AtrStopList atrStopList = new(lookbackPeriods, multiplier: 3.0, endType: EndType.Close);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  atrStopList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<AtrStopResult>`
IReadOnlyList<AtrStopResult> results = atrStopList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
AtrStopHub observer = barHub.ToAtrStopHub(lookbackPeriods, multiplier: 3.0, endType: EndType.Close);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<AtrStopResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
