# Schaff Trend Cycle

Created by Doug Schaff, the [Schaff Trend Cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/schaff-trend-cycle-indicator.asp) is a stochastic oscillator view of two converging/diverging exponential moving averages.  In other words, it's a Stochastic Oscillator of Moving Average Convergence / Divergence (MACD).

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<StcResult> results =
  quotes.ToStc(cyclePeriods, fastPeriods, slowPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `cyclePeriods` | int | Number of periods (`C`) for the Trend Cycle.  Must be greater than or equal to 0.  Default is 10. |
| `fastPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`F`) for the faster moving average.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 23. |
| `slowPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`S`) for the slower moving average.  Must be greater than `fastPeriods`.  Default is 50. |

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2×(S+C)` or `S+C+100` worth of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `S+C+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<StcResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `S+C` slow periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `S+C+250` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### `StcResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | DateTime | Date from evaluated `TQuote` |
| `Stc` | double | Schaff Trend Cycle |

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .ToStc(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Stc` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .ToStc(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
StcList stcList = new(cyclePeriods, fastPeriods, slowPeriods);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  stcList.Add(quote);
}

// based on `ICollection<StcResult>`
IReadOnlyList<StcResult> results = stcList;
```

Subscribe to a `QuoteHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
QuoteHub quoteHub = new();
StcHub observer = quoteHub.ToStcHub(cyclePeriods, fastPeriods, slowPeriods);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  quoteHub.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<StcResult> results = observer.Results;
```
