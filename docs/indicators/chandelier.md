# Chandelier Exit

Created by Charles Le Beau, the [Chandelier Exit](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:chandelier_exit) is an adjusted Average True Range (ATR) offset from price that is typically used for stop-loss and can be computed for both long or short types.

  <StockIndicatorChart indicator="Chandelier" />
</ClientOnly>

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<ChandelierResult> results =
  bars.ToChandelier(lookbackPeriods, multiplier, type);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) for the lookback evaluation.  Default is 22. |
| `multiplier` | _`double`_ | Multiplier number must be a positive value.  Default is 3. |
| `type` | _`Direction`_ | Direction of exit. Default is `Direction.Long`. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `N+1` periods of `bars` to cover the warmup periods.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

<!--@include: ../shared/enum-direction.md-->

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<ChandelierResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` Chandelier values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### `ChandelierResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `ChandelierExit` | _`double`_ | Exit line |

- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(removePeriods)](/utilities/results#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and helpers](/utilities/) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `ChandelierExit` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .ToChandelier(..)
    .ToEma(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `bars` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
ChandelierList chandelierList = new(lookbackPeriods, multiplier, type);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  chandelierList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<ChandelierResult>`
IReadOnlyList<ChandelierResult> results = chandelierList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
ChandelierHub observer = barHub.ToChandelierHub(lookbackPeriods, multiplier, type);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<ChandelierResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
