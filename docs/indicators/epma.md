# Endpoint Moving Average (EPMA)

Endpoint Moving Average (EPMA), also known as Least Squares Moving Average (LSMA), plots the projected last point of a defined retrospective linear regression.

  <StockIndicatorChart indicator="Epma" />
</ClientOnly>

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<EpmaResult> results =
  bars.ToEpma(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) in the moving average.  Must be greater than 0. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `bars` to cover the warmup periods.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<EpmaResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### `EpmaResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `Epma` | _`double`_ | Endpoint moving average |

## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .ToEpma(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `Epma` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = bars
    .ToEpma(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
EpmaList epmaList = new(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  epmaList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<EpmaResult>`
IReadOnlyList<EpmaResult> results = epmaList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
EpmaHub observer = barHub.ToEpmaHub(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<EpmaResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
