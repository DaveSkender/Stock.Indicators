  <StockIndicatorChart indicator="Donchian" />
</ClientOnly>

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<DonchianResult> results =
  bars.ToDonchian(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | _`int`_ | Number of periods (`N`) for lookback period.  Must be greater than 0 to calculate; however we suggest a larger value for an appropriate sample size.  Default is 20. |

### Historical price bars requirements

You must have at least `N+1` periods of `bars` to cover the warmup periods.

`bars` is a collection of generic `TBar` historical price bars.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide/getting-started#historical-bars) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<DonchianResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `bars` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical price bars.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.

### `DonchianResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | _`DateTime`_ | Date from evaluated `TBar` |
| `UpperBand` | _`double`_ | Upper line is the highest High over `N` periods |
| `Centerline` | _`double`_ | Simple average of Upper and Lower bands |
| `LowerBand` | _`double`_ | Lower line is the lowest Low over `N` periods |
| `Width` | _`double`_ | Width as percent of Centerline price.  `(UpperBand-LowerBand)/Centerline` |

## Chaining

This indicator is not chain-enabled and must be generated from `bars`.  It **cannot** be used for further processing by other chain-enabled indicators.

See [Chaining indicators](/guide/chaining) for more.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
DonchianList donchianList = new(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  donchianList.Add(bar);
}

// based on `ICollection<DonchianResult>`
IReadOnlyList<DonchianResult> results = donchianList;
```

Subscribe to a `BarHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
BarHub barHub = new();
DonchianHub observer = barHub.ToDonchianHub(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IBar bar in bars)  // simulating stream
{
  barHub.Add(bar);
}

IReadOnlyList<DonchianResult> results = observer.Results;
```

See [Buffer lists](/guide/styles/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/guide/styles/stream) for full usage guides.
