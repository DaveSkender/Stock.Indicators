# Elder-ray Index

Created by Alexander Elder, the [Elder-ray Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elderray.asp), also known as Bull and Bear Power, is an oscillator that depicts buying and selling pressure.  It compares current high/low prices against an Exponential Moving Average.

```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<ElderRayResult> results =
  quotes.ToElderRay(lookbackPeriods);
```

## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lookbackPeriods` | int | Number of periods (`N`) for the underlying EMA evaluation.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 13. |

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `2×N` or `N+100` periods of `quotes`, whichever is more, to cover the [warmup and convergence](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/688) periods.  Since this uses a smoothing technique, we recommend you use at least `N+250` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<ElderRayResult>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` indicator values since there's not enough data to calculate.

::: warning ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `N+100` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.

### `ElderRayResult`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | DateTime | Date from evaluated `TQuote` |
| `Ema` | double | Exponential moving average |
| `BullPower` | double | Bull Power |
| `BearPower` | double | Bear Power |

### Utilities

- [.Condense()](/utilities/results#condense)
- [.Find(lookupDate)](/utilities/results#find-indicator-result-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()](/utilities/results#remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(qty)](/utilities/results#remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and helpers](/utilities/results) for more information.

## Chaining

Results can be further processed on `(BullPower+BearPower)` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .ToElderRay(..)
    .ToEma(..);
```

This indicator must be generated from `quotes` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.

## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
ElderRayList elderRayList = new(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  elderRayList.Add(quote);
}

// based on `ICollection<ElderRayResult>`
IReadOnlyList<ElderRayResult> results = elderRayList;
```

Subscribe to a `QuoteHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
QuoteHub quoteHub = new();
ElderRayHub observer = quoteHub.ToElderRayHub(lookbackPeriods);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  quoteHub.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<ElderRayResult> results = observer.Results;
```
