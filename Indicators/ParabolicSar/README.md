# Parabolic SAR

Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) is a price-time based indicator.
[More info ...](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:parabolic_sar)

```csharp
// usage
IEnumerable<ParabolicSarResult> results = Indicator.GetParabolicSar(history, accelerationStep, maxAccelerationFactor);  
```

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `history` | IEnumerable\<[Quote](../../GUIDE.md#quote)\> | Historical Quotes data should be at any consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  Provide sufficient history to capture prior trend reversals, before your usage period.  At least two history records are required to calculate; however, we recommend at least 100 data points.
| `accelerationStep` | decimal | Incremental step size.  Must be greater than 0.  Default is 0.02
| `maxAccelerationFactor` | decimal | Maximimum step limit.  Must be greater than 0 and larger than `accelerationStep`.  Default is 0.2

NOTE: Initial Parabolic SAR values before the first reversal are not accurate.

## Response

```csharp
IEnumerable<ParabolicSarResult>
```

The first period will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.  We always return the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.

### ParabolicSarResult

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Index` | int | Sequence of dates
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Sar` | decimal | Stop and Reverse value
| `IsReversal` | bool | Indicates a trend reversal
| `IsRising` | bool | Rising (true), Falling (false)

## Example

```csharp
// fetch historical quotes from your favorite feed, in Quote format
IEnumerable<Quote> history = GetHistoryFromFeed("SPY");

// calculate ParabolicSar(0.02,0.2)
IEnumerable<ParabolicSarResult> results = Indicator.GetParabolicSar(history,0.02,0.2);

// use results as needed
DateTime evalDate = DateTime.Parse("12/31/2018");
ParabolicSarResult result = results.Where(x=>x.Date==evalDate).FirstOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine("SAR on {0} was ${1}", result.Date, result.Sar);
```

```bash
SAR on 12/31/2018 was $229.76
```
