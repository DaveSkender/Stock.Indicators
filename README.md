# Stock Indicators for .NET

**Stock Indicators for .NET** is a C# [library package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skender.Stock.Indicators) that produces financial market technical indicators.  Send in historical price quotes and get back desired indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index, Stochastic Oscillator, Parabolic SAR, etc.  Nothing more.

Build your technical analysis, trading algorithms, machine learning, charting, or other intelligent market software with this library and your own [OHLCV](https://dotnet.stockindicators.dev/guide/#historical-quotes) price quotes sources for equities, commodities, forex, cryptocurrencies, and others.  [Stock Indicators for Python](https://python.stockindicators.dev/) is also available.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Skender.Stock.Indicators
```

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using Skender.Stock.Indicators;

// Get historical quotes from your data source
IEnumerable<IQuote> quotes = GetHistoricalQuotes();

// Calculate 20-period simple moving average
IEnumerable<SmaResult> results = quotes.GetSma(20);
```
