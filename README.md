# Stock Indicators for .NET

**Stock Indicators for .NET** is a C# [library package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FacioQuo.Stock.Indicators) that produces financial market technical indicators.  Send in historical price bars and get back desired indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index, Stochastic Oscillator, Parabolic SAR, etc.  Nothing more.

Build your technical analysis, trading algorithms, machine learning, charting, or other intelligent market software with this library and your own [OHLCV](https://dotnet.stockindicators.dev/guide/#historical-bars) price bars sources for equities, commodities, forex, cryptocurrencies, and others.

> _This **`FacioQuo.Stock.Indicators`** NuGet package was formerly named `Skender.Stock.Indicators`_

## Streaming support

v3 introduces comprehensive **streaming capabilities** for real-time and incremental data processing. Most indicators now support three calculation styles:

- **Series** - Traditional batch processing for complete historical datasets
- **BufferList** - Incremental calculations with simple, efficient buffer management
- **StreamHub** - Real-time processing with observable patterns and state management

Quick example using streaming:

```csharp
// Create a hub for streaming price bars
BarHub barHub = new();

// Subscribe indicators to the hub
EmaHub emaHub = barHub.ToEma(20);
RsiHub rsiHub = barHub.ToRsi(14);

// Stream bars as they arrive
foreach (Bar bar in liveBars)
{
    barHub.Add(bar);
    
    // Access real-time results
    EmaResult emaResult = emaHub.Results[^1];
    RsiResult rsiResult = rsiHub.Results[^1];
}
```
