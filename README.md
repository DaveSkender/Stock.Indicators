## Prerequisite data

Most indicators require that you provide historical quote data and additional configuration parameters.

You can get historical quotes from your favorite stock data provider.
Historical data is an `IEnumerable` of the `Quote` class.

For additional configuration parameters, default values are provided when there is an industry standard.
You can, of course, override these and provide your own values.

### Quote

Historical quotes should be of consistent time frequency (e.g. per minute, hour, day, etc.).

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `Date` | DateTime | Date
| `Open` | decimal | Open price
| `High` | decimal | High price
| `Low` | decimal | Low price
| `Close` | decimal | Close price
| `Volume` | long | Volume
