## Phase 4: Optional Future Enhancements (Post v3.0.0)

### Additional Indicators (Lower Priority)

The following indicators exist as StaticSeries but could benefit from streaming implementations in future releases:

- **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**: Volume-based indicator
- **Aroon**: Trend strength indicator
- **Parabolic SAR**: Stop and reverse indicator
- **Additional oscillators and trend indicators**

These are NOT required for v3.0.0 stable release but could be added based on community demand and usage patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach

1. **Pattern Replication**: Use proven EMA/SMA/HMA/WMA streaming patterns established as templates
2. **Incremental Rollout**: Implement indicators in order of usage frequency
3. **Performance First**: Maintain sub-millisecond single quote processing
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure seamless v2.x API compatibility

### Quality Assurance

- Streaming vs batch mathematical accuracy validation
- Memory profiling for extended operations
- Performance benchmarking against v2.x baselines
- Real-world usage scenario testing

### Risk Mitigation

- Parallel development tracks to avoid blocking dependencies
- Preview releases for incremental feedback
- Rollback strategies for performance regressions
- Community engagement throughout development

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- Single quote processing: < 1ms for all streaming indicators
- Memory stability: No leaks during 24hr streaming operations
- Throughput: Support 1000+ quotes/second for common indicators
- Latency: Real-time chart updates with <10ms delay

### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage: >95% for all streaming implementations
- Documentation completeness: 100% API coverage
- User satisfaction: Positive feedback from preview releases
- Compatibility: Zero breaking changes for existing v2.x code

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies

- Community feedback from preview releases
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- Documentation publishing pipeline
- Release management processes

### Technical Constraints

- .NET 9.0+ target framework requirements
- Memory efficiency for high-frequency trading scenarios
- Thread safety for concurrent streaming operations
- API stability for production trading systems
- Universal buffer utilities for consistent memory management across all streaming indicators
