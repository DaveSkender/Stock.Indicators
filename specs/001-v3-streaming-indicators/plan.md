  - T3BufferList with volume factor parameter support
  - T3StreamHub for real-time processing
  - Comprehensive test coverage and catalog integration

### ‚úÖ Completed September 2025

- **All Phase 1 Moving Average Indicators**: Complete BufferList and StreamHub implementations
  - HMA, WMA, TEMA, VWMA, DEMA, ALMA, KAMA, SMMA, EPMA, MAMA
- **All Phase 1 Technical Indicators**: Complete BufferList and StreamHub implementations
  - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator
- **All Phase 1 Volume/Trend Indicators**: Complete BufferList and StreamHub implementations
  - OBV, ADX
- **Universal Buffer Utilities**: Extension methods for consistent buffer management across all indicators
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: BufferList and StreamHub tests for all implemented indicators
- **Catalog Integration**: All streaming indicators integrated with catalog automation system
- **Code Quality**: All BufferList implementations refactored to use universal utilities

### üéØ Remaining Critical Work

The following items from #1014 need completion before stable v3 release:

## Phase 1: Broad Indicator Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Objective

Expand streaming support from EMA/SMA base cases to most common indicators

### Scope - COMPLETED

- **Moving Average Indicators**: ‚úÖ ALL COMPLETE (HMA, WMA, TEMA, VWMA, DEMA, ALMA, KAMA, SMMA, EPMA, MAMA, T3)
- **Common Technical Indicators**: ‚úÖ ALL COMPLETE (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic)
- **Volume Indicators**: ‚úÖ OBV COMPLETE
- **Trend Indicators**: ‚úÖ ADX COMPLETE

### Outstanding Items

- **Chaikin Money Flow**: Not yet implemented (lower priority)
- **Aroon**: Not yet implemented (lower priority)
- **Parabolic SAR**: Not yet implemented (lower priority)

### Success Criteria - ACHIEVED

- ‚úÖ All common indicators support streaming mode
- ‚úÖ Performance parity with existing EMA/SMA implementations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage for streaming vs batch accuracy
- ‚úÖ Memory usage remains stable across all implementations
- ‚úÖ Universal buffer utilities established for consistent patterns

## Phase 2: Advanced Documentation and Integration (Priority 1 - CURRENT FOCUS)

### Documentation Enhancement - IN PROGRESS

- **Issue #1403**: ‚ùå Complete streaming indicators documentation gaps (NOT STARTED)
- ‚ùå Streaming API usage guides and examples (NOT STARTED)
- ‚ùå Performance characteristics documentation (NOT STARTED)
- ‚ùå Migration guide from v2.x to v3.x streaming APIs (NOT STARTED)
- ‚ùå Best practices for real-time data integration (NOT STARTED)
- ‚ùå WebSocket integration examples (NOT STARTED)

### Integration Requirements - MOSTLY COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Catalog system integration for all streaming indicators (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Automated discovery of streaming capabilities (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline updates for streaming tests (VERIFIED COMPLETE - October 2025)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance benchmarking integration (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

## Phase 3: Final Validation and Release Preparation (Priority 2)

### Feedback Integration - NOT STARTED

- ‚ùå Collect and analyze user feedback from preview releases
- ‚ùå Address performance and usability concerns
- ‚ùå Finalize API design based on community input
- ‚ùå Complete breaking change documentation

### Release Readiness - NOT STARTED

- ‚ùå Performance regression testing across all indicators
- ‚ùå Memory leak validation for extended streaming operations
- ‚ùå Documentation completeness verification
- ‚ùå Migration tooling and guidance
- ‚ùå Stable v3.0.0 release preparation

## Phase 4: Optional Future Enhancements (Post v3.0.0)

### Additional Indicators (Lower Priority)

The following indicators exist as StaticSeries but could benefit from streaming implementations in future releases:

- **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**: Volume-based indicator
- **Aroon**: Trend strength indicator
- **Parabolic SAR**: Stop and reverse indicator
- **Additional oscillators and trend indicators**

These are NOT required for v3.0.0 stable release but could be added based on community demand and usage patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach

1. **Pattern Replication**: Use proven EMA/SMA/HMA/WMA streaming patterns established as templates
2. **Incremental Rollout**: Implement indicators in order of usage frequency
3. **Performance First**: Maintain sub-millisecond single quote processing
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure seamless v2.x API compatibility

### Quality Assurance

- Streaming vs batch mathematical accuracy validation
- Memory profiling for extended operations
- Performance benchmarking against v2.x baselines
- Real-world usage scenario testing

### Risk Mitigation

- Parallel development tracks to avoid blocking dependencies
- Preview releases for incremental feedback
- Rollback strategies for performance regressions
- Community engagement throughout development

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- Single quote processing: < 1ms for all streaming indicators
- Memory stability: No leaks during 24hr streaming operations
- Throughput: Support 1000+ quotes/second for common indicators
- Latency: Real-time chart updates with <10ms delay

### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage: >95% for all streaming implementations
- Documentation completeness: 100% API coverage
- User satisfaction: Positive feedback from preview releases
- Compatibility: Zero breaking changes for existing v2.x code

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies

- Community feedback from preview releases
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- Documentation publishing pipeline
- Release management processes

### Technical Constraints

- .NET 9.0+ target framework requirements
- Memory efficiency for high-frequency trading scenarios
- Thread safety for concurrent streaming operations
- API stability for production trading systems
- Universal buffer utilities for consistent memory management across all streaming indicators
