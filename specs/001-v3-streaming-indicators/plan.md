# Implementation Plan: v3.0 Streaming Indicators Completion

## Overview

This plan focuses on completing the remaining work for v3.0 streaming indicators as outlined in [issue #1014](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/issues/1014) and the [v3 project board](https://github.com/users/DaveSkender/projects/6?pane=issue&itemId=58144081).

## Current Status Assessment

Based on issue #1014, significant progress has been made:

### âœ… Completed Core Infrastructure

- Core quote provider and handling mechanisms
- EMA and SMA streaming prototypes
- Basic `.Use(..)` chaining functionality
- Multiple preview releases with feedback incorporation
- Performance tuning and usability testing
- Buffer-style incrementors for EMA
- Index operations avoiding "Get" overuses
- Base documentation improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Critical Work

The following items from #1014 need completion before stable v3 release:

## Phase 1: Broad Indicator Implementation (Priority 1)

### Objective

Expand streaming support from EMA/SMA base cases to most common indicators

### Scope

- **Moving Average Indicators**: Implement streaming for HMA, TEMA, VWMA, LWMA, T3
- **Common Technical Indicators**: Implement streaming for RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic
- **Volume Indicators**: Implement streaming for OBV, Chaikin Money Flow
- **Trend Indicators**: Implement streaming for ADX, Aroon, Parabolic SAR

### Success Criteria

- All common indicators support streaming mode
- Performance parity with existing EMA/SMA implementations
- Comprehensive test coverage for streaming vs batch accuracy
- Memory usage remains stable across all implementations

## Phase 2: Advanced Documentation and Integration (Priority 2)

### Documentation Enhancement

- **Issue #1403**: Complete streaming indicators documentation gaps
- Streaming API usage guides and examples
- Performance characteristics documentation
- Migration guide from v2.x to v3.x streaming APIs
- Best practices for real-time data integration

### Integration Requirements

- Catalog system integration for all streaming indicators
- Automated discovery of streaming capabilities
- Performance benchmarking integration
- CI/CD pipeline updates for streaming tests

## Phase 3: Final Validation and Release Preparation (Priority 3)

### Feedback Integration

- Collect and analyze user feedback from preview releases
- Address performance and usability concerns
- Finalize API design based on community input
- Complete breaking change documentation

### Release Readiness

- Performance regression testing across all indicators
- Memory leak validation for extended streaming operations
- Documentation completeness verification
- Migration tooling and guidance
- Stable v3.0.0 release preparation

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach

1. **Pattern Replication**: Use proven EMA/SMA streaming patterns as templates
2. **Incremental Rollout**: Implement indicators in order of usage frequency
3. **Performance First**: Maintain sub-millisecond single quote processing
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure seamless v2.x API compatibility

### Quality Assurance

- Streaming vs batch mathematical accuracy validation
- Memory profiling for extended operations
- Performance benchmarking against v2.x baselines
- Real-world usage scenario testing

### Risk Mitigation

- Parallel development tracks to avoid blocking dependencies
- Preview releases for incremental feedback
- Rollback strategies for performance regressions
- Community engagement throughout development

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- Single quote processing: < 1ms for all streaming indicators
- Memory stability: No leaks during 24hr streaming operations
- Throughput: Support 1000+ quotes/second for common indicators
- Latency: Real-time chart updates with <10ms delay

### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage: >95% for all streaming implementations
- Documentation completeness: 100% API coverage
- User satisfaction: Positive feedback from preview releases
- Compatibility: Zero breaking changes for existing v2.x code

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies

- Community feedback from preview releases
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- Documentation publishing pipeline
- Release management processes

### Technical Constraints

- .NET 9.0+ target framework requirements
- Memory efficiency for high-frequency trading scenarios
- Thread safety for concurrent streaming operations
- API stability for production trading systems
