# StreamHub Implementation Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality and completeness for StreamHub indicator implementations
**Created**: October 7, 2025 | **Simplified**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [tasks.md](../tasks.md)
**Instructions**: [indicator-stream.instructions.md](../../../.github/instructions/indicator-stream.instructions.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates requirement quality for StreamHub implementations. Focus on essential constitution compliance and instruction file adherence.

## Constitution Compliance (CRITICAL)

- [x] CHK001 - Mathematical Precision: Are requirements for deterministic equality with Series baseline explicitly defined? [Constitution §1]
- [x] CHK002 - Performance First: Are O(1) state updates and <5ms latency requirements specified? [Constitution §2]
- [x] CHK003 - Comprehensive Validation: Are input validation and state isolation requirements complete? [Constitution §3]
- [x] CHK004 - Test-Driven Quality: Are stateful processing, reset behavior, and parity test requirements defined? [Constitution §4]
- [x] CHK005 - Documentation Excellence: Are XML documentation and streaming usage example requirements specified? [Constitution §5]

## Instruction File Adherence

- [x] CHK006 - Provider Base: Are `ChainProvider`/`QuoteProvider`/`PairsProvider` selection criteria explicit? [Instructions §Core Stream Hub Structure]
- [x] CHK007 - Test Interfaces: Are requirements for correct test interface implementation clear (`ITestChainObserver`, `ITestQuoteObserver`, `ITestPairsObserver`)? [Instructions §Test Interface Selection Guide]
- [x] CHK008 - Provider History: Are Insert/Remove testing requirements specified for state management validation? [Instructions §Provider History Testing]
- [x] CHK009 - Observer Pattern: Are `IStreamObservable`/`IStreamObserver` requirements defined? [Instructions §Core Stream Hub Structure]
- [x] CHK010 - Performance Benchmarks: Are requirements for high-frequency processing benchmarks specified? [Instructions §Performance Benchmarking]

## Essential Quality Gates

- [x] CHK011 - Requirement Clarity: Are all requirements measurable and unambiguous?
- [x] CHK012 - Coverage Completeness: Do requirements cover all mandatory implementation aspects?
- [x] CHK013 - Consistency Check: Are requirements consistent with existing codebase patterns?
- [x] CHK014 - Acceptance Criteria: Are test criteria specific and verifiable?
- [x] CHK015 - Reference Alignment: Do requirements reference authoritative instruction files?

## Dual-Stream Specific (PairsProvider)

- [x] CHK016 - Synchronization: Are timestamp synchronization validation requirements defined? [Instructions §Dual-stream Hub Structure]
- [x] CHK017 - Sufficient Data: Are dual-cache data validation requirements specified? [Instructions §PairsProvider Base Class]
- [x] CHK018 - Test Coverage: Are `ITestPairsObserver` requirements clear for dual-stream indicators? [Instructions §Test Interface Selection Guide]

**Total Items**: 18 essential validation items (15 core + 3 dual-stream specific)
**Focus**: Constitution compliance + instruction file adherence + essential quality gates + dual-stream support
**Simplified**: Reduced from 145+ items to comply with Constitution Principle 6 (Simplicity over Feature Creep)
