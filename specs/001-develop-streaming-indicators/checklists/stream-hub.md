## Notes

- This checklist validates REQUIREMENTS quality for StreamHub implementations - NOT implementation correctness
- Each item checks if requirements are complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and cover all scenarios
- Check items as requirements are clarified, documented, or validated
- Use traceability references to link requirements back to specifications and instruction files
- Add findings or gaps discovered during requirements review inline
- StreamHub emphasizes high-frequency, low-latency scenarios requiring span-based optimizations

**Checklist Items**: 145
**Coverage**: Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Acceptance Criteria, Scenarios, Edge Cases, NFRs, Dependencies, Ambiguities, Traceability, Developer Docs (XML), User Docs (Website), Maintainer Docs (Migration), Patterns, Quality Standards, I/O Patterns, Reference Implementations, Real-Time Processing, Regression Testing

**Key Requirements**:

1. **CRITICAL**: Test classes MUST inherit from `StreamHubTestBase`, NOT `TestBase` directly (CHK035, CHK035a, CHK108, CHK109)
2. Tests must use deterministic equality (`BeEquivalentTo` or exact `Should().Be()`) - NO approximate equality (CHK103)
3. StreamHub tests must implement appropriate interfaces:
   - `ITestChainObserver` when indicator supports chainable inputs (CHK110)
4. Implementation must align with idiomatic reference patterns (EMA, SMA, AtrStop, Alligator examples)
5. High-frequency processing requires span-based optimizations and bounded buffers for minimal allocations
6. **Regression tests**: StreamHub implementations require regression test with `Stream()` method that validates against baseline using shared `quoteHub` (CHK137-CHK145)
