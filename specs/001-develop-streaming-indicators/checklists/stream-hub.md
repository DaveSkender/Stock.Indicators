## Notes

- This checklist validates REQUIREMENTS quality for StreamHub implementations - NOT implementation correctness
- Each item checks if requirements are complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and cover all scenarios
- Check items as requirements are clarified, documented, or validated
- Use traceability references to link requirements back to specifications and instruction files
- Add findings or gaps discovered during requirements review inline
- StreamHub emphasizes high-frequency, low-latency scenarios requiring span-based optimizations
