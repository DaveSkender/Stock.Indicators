# BufferList Implementation Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality and completeness for BufferList indicator implementations
**Created**: October 7, 2025 | **Simplified**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [tasks.md](../tasks.md)
**Instructions**: [indicator-buffer.instructions.md](../../../.github/instructions/indicator-buffer.instructions.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates requirement quality for BufferList implementations. Focus on essential constitution compliance and instruction file adherence.

## Constitution Compliance (CRITICAL)

- [x] CHK001 - Mathematical Precision: Are requirements for deterministic equality with Series baseline explicitly defined? [Constitution §1]
- [x] CHK002 - Performance First: Are O(1) buffer operations and bounded memory requirements specified? [Constitution §2]
- [x] CHK003 - Comprehensive Validation: Are input validation and error handling requirements complete? [Constitution §3]
- [x] CHK004 - Test-Driven Quality: Are unit test, parity test, and regression test requirements defined? [Constitution §4]
- [x] CHK005 - Documentation Excellence: Are XML documentation and usage example requirements specified? [Constitution §5]

## Instruction File Adherence

- [x] CHK006 - Base Class: Are `BufferList<TResult>` inheritance requirements explicit? [Instructions §Implementation Requirements]
- [x] CHK007 - Interface Selection: Are criteria for `IIncrementFromChain`/`IIncrementFromQuote`/`IIncrementFromPairs` clear? [Instructions §Interface Selection]
- [x] CHK008 - Constructor Pattern: Are both constructor variants (params-only and params+quotes) mandatory? [Instructions §Constructor Requirements]
- [x] CHK009 - Buffer Management: Are `BufferListUtilities` extension method requirements specified? [Instructions §Universal Buffer Utilities]
- [x] CHK010 - Test Base: Are `BufferListTestBase` inheritance and test interface requirements defined? [Instructions §Testing Requirements]

## Essential Quality Gates

- [x] CHK011 - Requirement Clarity: Are all requirements measurable and unambiguous?
- [x] CHK012 - Coverage Completeness: Do requirements cover all mandatory implementation aspects?
- [x] CHK013 - Consistency Check: Are requirements consistent with existing codebase patterns?
- [x] CHK014 - Acceptance Criteria: Are test criteria specific and verifiable?
- [x] CHK015 - Reference Alignment: Do requirements reference authoritative instruction files?

**Total Items**: 15 essential validation items
**Focus**: Constitution compliance + instruction file adherence + essential quality gates
**Simplified**: Reduced from 135+ items to comply with Constitution Principle 6 (Simplicity over Feature Creep)
