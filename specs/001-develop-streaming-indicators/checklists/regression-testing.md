**Total Items**: 84 requirement quality validation items

**Summary**: This checklist validates requirements for incorporating regression tests into the streaming indicators framework, following the pattern established in PR #1506. It ensures requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and testable for all three implementation styles (Series, BufferList, StreamHub), with proper baseline generation, test isolation, and CI/CD integration.

**Usage**: Review this checklist before implementing regression tests for each streaming indicator to ensure all requirement quality dimensions are addressed. Update indicator specification ([spec.md](../spec.md)) and implementation plan ([plan.md](../plan.md)) to resolve any gaps, ambiguities, or conflicts identified.
