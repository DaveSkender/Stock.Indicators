# Regression Testing Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality and completeness for regression test implementation
**Created**: October 9, 2025 | **Simplified**: October 13, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [tasks.md](../tasks.md)
**Reference**: PR #1506 regression test pattern

**Note**: This checklist validates requirement quality for regression testing implementations. Focus on essential constitution compliance and testing framework adherence.

## Constitution Compliance (CRITICAL)

- [x] CHK001 - Mathematical Precision: Are requirements for deterministic equality with Series baseline explicitly defined? [Constitution §1]
- [x] CHK002 - Performance First: Are regression test execution time requirements specified (<5 seconds per indicator)? [Constitution §2]
- [x] CHK003 - Comprehensive Validation: Are regression test coverage requirements complete (Series, Buffer, Stream)? [Constitution §3]
- [x] CHK004 - Test-Driven Quality: Are baseline generation, validation, and parity test requirements defined? [Constitution §4]
- [x] CHK005 - Documentation Excellence: Are regression test patterns and usage requirements specified? [Constitution §5]

## Testing Framework Adherence

- [x] CHK006 - Base Class: Are `RegressionTestBase<TResult>` inheritance requirements explicit? [TestBase.cs]
- [x] CHK007 - Test Methods: Are three test method requirements clearly defined (Series, Buffer, Stream)? [TestBase.cs]
- [x] CHK008 - Baseline Files: Are baseline file location and naming requirements specified (`tests/indicators/_testdata/results/{indicator}.standard.json`)? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK009 - Test Category: Are test categorization requirements documented (`[TestCategory("Regression")]`)? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK010 - Assertions: Are `AssertEquals` helper usage requirements defined (deterministic equality, no approximation)? [TestBase.cs]

## Essential Quality Gates

- [x] CHK011 - Requirement Clarity: Are all requirements measurable and unambiguous?
- [x] CHK012 - Coverage Completeness: Do requirements cover all mandatory implementation aspects?
- [x] CHK013 - Consistency Check: Are requirements consistent with existing codebase patterns?
- [x] CHK014 - Acceptance Criteria: Are test criteria specific and verifiable?
- [x] CHK015 - Reference Alignment: Do requirements reference authoritative test patterns?

## Implementation Scenarios

- [x] CHK016 - Incremental Implementation: Are `Assert.Inconclusive` requirements specified for unavailable implementations? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK017 - Baseline Generation: Are baseline generation utility requirements documented (`tools/baselining`)? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK018 - Test Isolation: Are regression test run settings requirements specified? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK019 - Parameter Alignment: Are requirements for catalog default parameter usage defined? [PR #1506]
- [x] CHK020 - StreamHub Integration: Are shared `quoteHub` property usage requirements explicit? [TestBase.cs]

**Total Items**: 20 essential validation items
**Focus**: Constitution compliance + testing framework adherence + essential quality gates + implementation scenarios
**Simplified**: Reduced from 84+ items to comply with Constitution Principle 6 (Simplicity over Feature Creep)
