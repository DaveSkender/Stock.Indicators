# Feature Specification: Streaming Indicators Framework

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-steaming-indicators`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "develop steaming indicators in two styles (buffering lists and more advanced stream hubs) to enable use of realtime financial market data streams that automatically generate indicator data incrementally."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer building real-time trading applications, I need indicators that update incrementally when new price data arrives, so that I can display live technical analysis without recalculating entire historical datasets every tick.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an initialized streaming indicator with historical warmup data, **When** a single new price quote arrives, **Then** the indicator produces one new result value in <5ms average latency
2. **Given** a buffering-style streaming indicator receiving quotes, **When** 1000 quotes are streamed sequentially, **Then** final indicator values match batch-calculated results within floating-point tolerance (1e-12)
3. **Given** a stream hub managing state across multiple ticks, **When** quotes arrive out-of-order within a tolerance window, **Then** the system either rejects invalid timestamps or reorders within buffer limits

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the first streamed quote has insufficient warmup history? System must validate minimum warmup period and reject or buffer until satisfied.
- How does the system handle duplicate timestamps? Must either skip duplicates or aggregate (e.g., volume-weighted) based on indicator semantics.
- What happens when memory limits are approached in buffering mode? Must enforce bounded buffer sizes and fail gracefully with clear error messages.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Library MUST provide two streaming indicator styles: BufferList (simpler, list-backed state) and StreamHub (advanced, optimized state management)
- **FR-002**: Streaming indicators MUST accept single quote additions incrementally and produce corresponding result values
- **FR-003**: Streaming indicators MUST maintain internal state (buffers, accumulators, derived values) across calls without recalculating from scratch
- **FR-004**: Final indicator values MUST converge to batch-calculated results within 1e-12 floating-point tolerance when same quote sequence is provided
- **FR-005**: Streaming indicators MUST validate warmup period requirements before producing results
- **FR-006**: Streaming indicators MUST enforce strictly ascending timestamps (reject or reorder within bounded tolerance)
- **FR-007**: BufferList style MUST use List-backed storage with O(1) append and bounded size enforcement
- **FR-008**: StreamHub style MUST optimize for high-frequency scenarios with span-based buffers and minimal allocations
- **FR-009**: Streaming indicators MUST provide a method to reset state and reinitialize warmup
- **FR-010**: Library MUST include streaming variants for core indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands (initial set)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Average per-tick update latency <5ms (p95 <10ms) for single indicator instance
- **NFR-002**: Memory overhead per streaming indicator instance <10KB for typical 200-period window
- **NFR-003**: Streaming parity tests MUST validate equivalence with batch calculations for all supported indicators
- **NFR-004**: API design MUST follow existing library conventions (no breaking changes to batch APIs)
- **NFR-005**: Documentation MUST include streaming usage examples, warmup guidance, and performance characteristics

### Key Entities

- **StreamingIndicator**: Base abstraction defining incremental update contract (Add quote â†’ produce result)
- **BufferList Indicator**: Concrete streaming style using List-backed state, simpler to understand and extend
- **StreamHub Indicator**: Concrete streaming style using optimized buffers, suitable for high-frequency scenarios
- **Quote**: Input entity representing OHLCV data with timestamp
- **Indicator Result**: Output entity with timestamp, indicator value(s), and metadata
- **Warmup State**: Tracks whether indicator has sufficient history to produce valid results
