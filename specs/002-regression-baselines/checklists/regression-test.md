# Regression Test Implementation Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for per-indicator regression test implementation  
**Scope**: Per-indicator test method requirements (T020, T022)  
**Audience**: Developer implementing regression tests for individual indicators  
**Created**: 2025-10-07

## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist validates that **requirements are properly specified** for each indicator's regression test implementation. Use this checklist:

- **Before implementing** each indicator's regression test (T020, T022)
- **During PR review** to verify test requirements are met
- **As a template** - apply to each of the 200+ indicator regression tests

**Important**: This checklist tests REQUIREMENTS QUALITY, not implementation correctness. Ask "Are requirements clear/complete?" not "Does the code work?"

## Constitution Principle I Enforcement

This checklist enforces Constitution Principle I (Mathematical Precision NON-NEGOTIABLE) through:

- CHK009, CHK010, CHK019-CHK021: Exact binary equality requirements
- CHK030-CHK032: Constitutional consistency validation
- CHK075-CHK077: Cross-platform deterministic output requirements

**Usage**: Apply this checklist to EACH indicator's regression test implementation. Every indicator (200+) must satisfy all applicable items.
