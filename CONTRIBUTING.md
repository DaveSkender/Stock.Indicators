```

## Branching and Naming Conventions

### Primary Branch

- **`main`** - The primary development branch
- All pull requests should target `main`
- Releases are tagged and deployed from `main`

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type and scope of changes:

```
feature/add-stochastic-rsi
fix/sma-null-handling
docs/update-readme
chore/update-dependencies
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Add Stochastic RSI indicator

- Implement StochasticRsi calculation method
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Update documentation with usage examples
```

For version control, we use semantic versioning with GitVersion:
- `+semver: major` - Breaking changes
- `+semver: minor` - New features (default for new indicators)
- `+semver: patch` - Bug fixes and minor changes

## Types of Contributions

### ‚úÖ We Accept

- **Bug reports and fixes**
- **Usability improvements**
- **Documentation updates**
- **New reputable "by the book" indicators and overlays**
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Test improvements**

### ‚ùå We Don't Accept

- Personal customizations and preferences
- Modified or augmented outputs that aren't intrinsic to the indicator
- Breaking changes without strong justification
- Features that should be implemented in wrapper code

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Use our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) and include:

- **Clear description** of the issue and expected behavior
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Code sample** that demonstrates the issue
- **Environment details** (library version, .NET version, OS)
- **Error messages** or stack traces
- **Additional context** like screenshots or related issues

### Feature Requests

Use our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) and include:

- **Problem statement** - What are you trying to solve?
- **Proposed solution** - Describe your preferred approach
- **Alternative solutions** - What else have you considered?
- **Reference materials** - Links, papers, or documentation
- **Additional context** - Urgency, willingness to contribute, etc.

### Before Reporting

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/issues)
- Review [community discussions](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions)
- Read [Help! Results don't match TradingView!](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/801)

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue** first (unless it's a trivial fix)
2. **Work on a feature branch** from your fork
3. **Follow coding standards** and include tests
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Submit a pull request** using our [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Link to related issues** in the PR description
- **Keep changes small and focused** - one feature/fix per PR
- **Include tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** for user-facing changes
- **Ensure CI passes** before requesting review

### Review Process

- All submissions require review before merging
- We may suggest changes, improvements, or alternatives
- Once approved, PRs are squash-merged to `main`
- Changes are batched before publishing to NuGet

## Testing

### Test Structure

- **`tests/indicators/`** - Unit tests for indicators
- **`tests/other/`** - Tests for utilities and edge cases
- **`tests/performance/`** - Performance benchmarks
- **`tests/examples/`** - Tests for example code

### Writing Tests

When adding new indicators:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void GetSma_Standard()
{
    // Test standard cases
    var results = quotes.GetSma(20).ToList();
    
    // Assertions for expected values
    Assert.AreEqual(502, results.Count);
    Assert.IsNull(results[18].Sma);
    Assert.AreEqual(214.5250m, Math.Round(results[19].Sma.Value, 4));
}

[TestMethod]
public void GetSma_BadData()
{
    // Test error conditions
    Assert.ThrowsException<ArgumentOutOfRangeException>(
        () => quotes.GetSma(0));
}
```

### Performance Tests

Include performance tests for new indicators:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void GetSma_Performance()
{
    var results = TestData.GetDefault(100_000)
        .GetSma(50)
        .ToList();
        
    Assert.AreEqual(100_000, results.Count);
}
```

## Documentation

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

Report security vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/security/advisories/new).

### Security Scanning

- **Code scanning** is enabled via GitHub Advanced Security
- **Secret scanning** prevents accidental credential commits
- **Dependency scanning** monitors for vulnerable packages
- **Codacy** provides additional code quality and security analysis

### Response Process

1. Security issues are reviewed within 48 hours
2. Fixes are prioritized and developed privately
3. Patches are released as soon as possible
4. Public disclosure follows responsible disclosure practices
