/// This is a <b>framework-level</b> property of every stateful hub (EMA and its
/// derivatives, every Wilder hub, and cumulative hubs), not a per-indicator bug.
/// The real fix is a framework state snapshot/restore mechanism tracked as a v3.1
/// architecture item in <c>docs/plans/streaming-indicators.plan.md</c>. Until then
