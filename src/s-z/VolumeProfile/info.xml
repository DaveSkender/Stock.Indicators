    Volume Profile breaks down historical volume data by price. The length of the bars represents the volume traded at each price, and indicates prices where significant support/resistance was encountered.
    Institutions do not create new orders based on the real-time price, at maximum precision, at a specific moment. Expecting to make X% profit, they post orders for Y volume, at Z price, then wait.
    The volume above/below that price is immediately consumed, as a taker, creating a void in the available volume around that price.
    As other investors adjust their orders to undercut, or "me too," that same price, the volume available concentrates around that price even further, expanding the void.
    Those orders, and the voids between them, appear as hills and valleys in the volume profile, representing normal volatility.
    Over time, the hills around those prices turn into tall mountains, with steep cliffs.
    A gap between any two such cliffs indicates that wicking is likely to occur between them.
    To profit, place limit orders at the prices with the longest volume profile bars. (Not financial advice!) :)
