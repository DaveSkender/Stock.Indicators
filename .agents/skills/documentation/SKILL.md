# Documentation skill

This skill covers writing and updating the VitePress documentation site located in the `docs/` folder, with focus on indicator reference pages.

## When to use this skill

- Adding a documentation page for a new indicator
- Updating an existing indicator page after API or behavioral changes
- Auditing indicator pages for structural consistency
- Adding chart panels, warnings, or special sections

## Documentation site overview

The site is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) and Vue 3.

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `docs/indicators/` | One `.md` file per indicator (the primary audience) |
| `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` | Site config — nav, sidebar, metadata |
| `docs/.vitepress/components/` | Vue components used inside Markdown |
| `docs/.vitepress/public/assets/` | Static images (webp, optimized) |
| `docs/.vitepress/public/data/` | Chart JSON files (one per indicator key) |
| `docs/guide.md` | Getting started guide |
| `docs/indicators.md` | Indicators landing/index page |
| `docs/utilities/` | Utility API reference pages |

### Local development

```bash
# from /docs folder
pnpm install
pnpm run docs:dev
# site opens at http://localhost:5173/
```

## Indicator page structure

Every indicator page at `docs/indicators/{Indicator}.md` follows this section order exactly. Never omit sections; use judgment about which optional elements apply.

### 1. Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Full Indicator Name (ABBR)
description: One-sentence description of what the indicator measures.
---
```

- `title`: Human-readable name with abbreviation in parentheses when one exists
- `description`: Concise (≤160 characters), plain-text sentence — used for SEO and link previews

### 2. H1 heading block

```markdown
# Full Indicator Name (ABBR)

Created by Author Name, [Indicator Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...) is a brief description of what it measures.
[[Discuss] &#128172;](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators/discussions/{id} "Community discussion about this indicator")

<IndicatorChartPanel indicator-key="{IndicatorKey}" />
```

Rules:

- Attribution ("Created by...") is required when a known author exists
- Include a Wikipedia link when one exists; otherwise link the most authoritative reference
- Always include the `[[Discuss]]` link using the correct GitHub Discussions URL
- Include `<IndicatorChartPanel>` when a chart JSON file exists at `docs/.vitepress/public/data/{IndicatorKey}.json`; omit when no chart data exists (e.g., simple primitives or secondary analysis pages)
- `indicator-key` must match the JSON filename exactly (PascalCase, no extension)

### 3. Usage syntax

````markdown
```csharp
// C# usage syntax
IReadOnlyList<{Indicator}Result> results =
  quotes.To{Indicator}(param1, param2);
```
````

- Use `// C# usage syntax` as the comment; add `(with Close price)` or similar qualifier when relevant
- Show each meaningful overload on separate `quotes.To{Indicator}(...)` lines when multiple overloads exist
- Wrap long signatures to the next line for readability

### 4. Parameters section

```markdown
## Parameters

| param | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `paramName` | int | Description with constraints. Default is N. |
```

Omit this section entirely when the indicator has no parameters (e.g., `ToAdl()`, `ToTr()`).

Parameter description rules:

- State the variable name used in formulas (e.g., "`N`" or "`S`")
- State validation constraints ("Must be greater than 0")
- State default value when one exists ("Default is 14")

#### Historical quotes requirements subsection

Always present, even for parameter-free indicators:

```markdown
### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least `N` periods of `quotes` to cover the warmup periods.

`quotes` is a collection of generic `TQuote` historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide](/guide#historical-quotes) for more information.
```

- Express the minimum in terms of formula variables (e.g., `N`, `2×(S+P)`, `S+P+100`)
- When the indicator uses exponential smoothing or recursive formulas, include an additional sentence recommending more data (e.g., "we recommend you use at least `10×N` data points prior to the intended usage date for better precision")

### 5. Response section

````markdown
## Response

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<{Indicator}Result>
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The first `N-1` periods will have `null` values since there's not enough data to calculate.
````

Adjust the null-period bullet to match the actual warmup (e.g., "The first `S-1` slow periods...").

#### Convergence warning (conditional)

Add immediately after the bullet list when the indicator uses a smoothing/recursive algorithm that introduces convergence error:

```markdown
::: warning ⚞ Convergence warning
The first `10×N` periods will have decreasing magnitude, convergence-related precision errors that can be as high as ~5% deviation in indicator values for earlier periods.
:::
```

Adjust the period count and percentage to match the indicator's actual convergence behavior.

#### Result type table

```markdown
### `{Indicator}Result`

| property | type | description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Timestamp` | DateTime | Date from evaluated `TQuote` |
| `PropertyName` | double | What this value represents |
```

- `Timestamp` is always the first row
- Use `double` for computed values, `decimal` for price-derived values (e.g., Ichimoku), `int` for counts
- Describe each property in plain language, including the formula when it aids understanding

#### Utilities subsection

```markdown
### Utilities

- [.Condense()](/utilities/results/condense)
- [.Find(lookupDate)](/utilities/results/find-by-date)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods()](/utilities/results/remove-warmup-periods)
- [.RemoveWarmupPeriods(removePeriods)](/utilities/results/remove-warmup-periods)

See [Utilities and helpers](/utilities/results/) for more information.
```

Omit `.RemoveWarmupPeriods(removePeriods)` overload when the indicator does not support a custom count.

### 6. Chaining section

````markdown
## Chaining

This indicator may be generated from any chain-enabled indicator or method.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .Use(CandlePart.HL2)
    .To{Indicator}(..);
```

Results can be further processed on `{PrimaryValue}` with additional chain-enabled indicators.

```csharp
// example
var results = quotes
    .To{Indicator}(..)
    .ToRsi(..);
```
````

Variations:

- When the indicator can only read from `quotes` (not chains), replace the first block with: `This indicator must be generated from \`quotes\` and **cannot** be generated from results of another chain-enabled indicator or method.`
- When the indicator can only output to chains (not read from them), describe that instead
- When chaining outputs to a specific property, note which property is the chainable value (e.g., "Note: \`TenkanSen\` is the primary reusable value for chaining purposes.")

End the section with a cross-reference to the usage guide:

```markdown
See [Chaining indicators](/features/batch#chaining) for more.
```

### 7. Streaming section

````markdown
## Streaming

Use the buffer-style `List<T>` when you need incremental calculations without a hub:

```csharp
{Indicator}List {indicator}List = new(param1, param2);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  {indicator}List.Add(quote);
}

// based on `ICollection<{Indicator}Result>`
IReadOnlyList<{Indicator}Result> results = {indicator}List;
```

Subscribe to a `QuoteHub` for advanced streaming scenarios:

```csharp
QuoteHub quoteHub = new();
{Indicator}Hub observer = quoteHub.To{Indicator}Hub(param1, param2);

foreach (IQuote quote in quotes)  // simulating stream
{
  quoteHub.Add(quote);
}

IReadOnlyList<{Indicator}Result> results = observer.Results;
```
````

When the hub subscribes to an upstream chain-enabled hub (not a `QuoteHub`), adjust the hub variable type and creation accordingly.

End the section with a cross-reference to the usage guides:

```markdown
See [Buffer lists](/features/buffer) and [Stream hubs](/features/stream) for full usage guides.
```

### 7a. Streaming not applicable

When an indicator cannot support streaming due to an architectural constraint, include `## Streaming` with this standard wording instead of examples:

```markdown
## Streaming

Streaming is not supported for this indicator.
{One sentence stating the architectural reason.}
Use the Series (batch) implementation with periodic recalculation instead.
```

Standard reasons by category:

- **Dual-series indicators** (Beta, Correlation, Prs): "This indicator requires a second synchronized quote series, which cannot be expressed in the single-series streaming model."
- **Lookahead/repaint indicators** (ZigZag): "This indicator requires lookahead to confirm reversal points; output repaints as new data arrives, making incremental results undefined."
- **Full-dataset algorithms** (StdDevChannels): "This indicator recalculates the entire dataset on each new data point, making incremental streaming impractical."

## Optional and conditional sections

### Inline warnings

Use VitePress admonition containers for notable caveats that don't warrant a full section:

```markdown
::: warning
Brief warning text here.
:::
```

Place these immediately after the content they qualify (e.g., after the result table).

### Extended or secondary indicator pages

When an indicator has a secondary analysis variant (e.g., `SmaAnalysis`), create a separate page. Secondary pages:

- Omit the `<IndicatorChartPanel>` (chart lives on the primary page)
- Begin the H1 body with a cross-link to the primary page: "See also [Simple Moving Average](/indicators/Sma)."
- Include the full Parameters, Response, Chaining, and Streaming sections for the variant

### Multiple overloads shown together

When an indicator has multiple overloads worth showing upfront (e.g., Ichimoku), show all meaningful signatures in a single code block before the Parameters table, with brief comments distinguishing each:

```csharp
// standard usage
IReadOnlyList<...> results = quotes.ToIndicator(a, b);

// usage with custom option
IReadOnlyList<...> results = quotes.ToIndicator(a, b, c);
```

### Multi-variant indicators (substantially different parameter sets)

When two variants share the same result type but have distinct parameter sets and different streaming support (e.g., Renko fixed-brick vs. ATR-derived), merge them into one page with a shared structure:

1. Show both signatures in the usage syntax block with distinguishing comments
2. Use `## Parameters` with H3 subsections per variant (`### Fixed brick size`, `### ATR-derived brick size`)
3. Combine `## Response` into one section (shared result type)
4. Combine `## Chaining` — note any variant-specific restrictions
5. In `## Streaming`, show full examples for the supported variant, then add a `warning` admonition for the unsupported variant:

````markdown
## Streaming

[Full buffer/hub examples for the supported variant]

::: warning
`ToVariantAtr()` does not support streaming.  {One sentence reason.}
:::
````

Do not create a separate H2 section for the unsupported variant — keep all streaming content under one `## Streaming` heading.

## Image assets

Chart images for the `<IndicatorChartPanel>` component are rendered from JSON data files at `docs/.vitepress/public/data/{IndicatorKey}.json`. When adding a new indicator:

1. Confirm whether a JSON data file exists for the indicator key
2. If it exists, add `<IndicatorChartPanel indicator-key="{IndicatorKey}" />` to the page
3. If it does not exist, omit the chart panel — do not add a placeholder

A second `<IndicatorChartPanel>` mid-page is valid when it illustrates a behaviorally distinct mode of the same indicator (e.g., StdDevChannels with `null` lookback renders differently than a fixed-period run; HtTrendline exposes both a trendline output and a dominant cycle period output). In that case, place the second panel immediately after the prose that introduces the distinct behavior, under its own H2 or H3 heading. Do not add a second panel merely to show the same output at different parameter values.

For static (non-chart) images referenced in prose:

- Store in `docs/.vitepress/public/assets/`
- Optimize to `webp` format at 832px width: `cwebp -resize 832 0 -q 100 examples.png -o examples-832.webp`
- Reference via absolute path from public root: `/assets/filename-832.webp`

## Checklist: adding a new indicator page

- [ ] Create `docs/indicators/{Indicator}.md` following the page structure above
- [ ] Frontmatter: `title` and `description` set
- [ ] H1 block: attribution, reference link, Discuss link, optional chart panel
- [ ] Usage syntax: all meaningful overloads shown
- [ ] Parameters table present (or section omitted if none)
- [ ] Historical quotes requirements stated
- [ ] Response section: return type, bullet list, result table, Utilities links
- [ ] Chaining section: correct chainability direction described
- [ ] Streaming section: full examples present, or "not applicable" note with architectural reason
- [ ] Site builds without errors: `pnpm run docs:dev` from `docs/`

## Checklist: updating an existing indicator page

- [ ] Identify sections affected by the code change
- [ ] Update parameter table if parameters added, removed, or renamed
- [ ] Update result table if result properties added, removed, or renamed
- [ ] Update usage syntax examples to match new signatures
- [ ] Update quotes requirements if warmup formula changed
- [ ] Add or remove convergence warning as appropriate
- [ ] Site builds without errors

## Style conventions

- Use two spaces (not one) between sentences in prose — the existing pages do this consistently
- Backtick inline code for all: type names, property names, parameter names, method names, numeric expressions like `N-1`
- Use `N`, `S`, `F`, `P` as single-letter formula variable shorthand — define them on first use
- Tables use the three-column format with aligned pipes
- Do not add commentary, caveats, or editorializing beyond what the code behavior requires — keep descriptions factual and concise
